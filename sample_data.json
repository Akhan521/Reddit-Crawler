{"id": "mdkw9xk", "body": "I am a massive fan of building solid code; but; and I have some serious buts on even how super safe super mission-critical code is often coded. \n\nI 100% agree that certain systems should be as bulletproof as is humanly possible; this could range from something on a mars rover, to making sure the arms on a train track level crossing go down each and every time a train comes along, and has a fail safe of either stopping the train, or the arms go down.\n\nI have two massive buts on how this is achieved, along with a solution that I have successfully used.\n\n* One is that that making a system perfectly safe is a massive amount of work. This is inherent in how it is traditionally done, but, this leads to a wildly unsafe situation. Often a super super safe system is \"perfectly\" designed, perfectly built, and then perfectly tested and deployed. Then the group who did this either move on, or are disbanded. If it proves to be problematic (not buggy) but has issues such as a level crossing arm which fails safe so often that it becomes the boy who cried wolf, then there is a non-zero chance that it won't get fixed. The end result is people start finding work arounds; unsafe workarounds. \n\nI can name one level crossing near me where they really got the associated traffic lights all wrong. The arm works as it should, but it the lights do not take into consideration how long some people might have been waiting. There is one turn where it is an advanced green for about 5 seconds (literally), and it is very easy to end up waiting at this turn for 20+ minutes, having started with 5 cars ahead of you.\n\nThe result of this is people turning on a read, or even scootering around the level crossing arms.\n\nThe city investigated fixing this, but being SIL the cost was insane; so more than a decade later, maybe 100,000 hours have been wasted by people waiting at this light 5 people 10 hours per day, 260 days per year for 10 years. \n\nI have read about many people defeating safety mechanisms because they were terrible. \n\nThe second problem with many safety coding approaches is to have potentially hundreds of rules. Each and every rule could be argued to have been written in blood. But, these rules start to impose a cognitive load on the programmers. Programmers have to keep a huge set of variables functions, etc dancing in their heads just to make code work; adding a cognitive load and some pedantic fool who is going to enforce the tiniest of these rules without common sense does not create a good coding environment.\n\nI am a much bigger fan of a much smaller set of rules and common sense approaches, while keeping programmers informed about various case studies where weird emergent bugs bit people on the butt. \n\nMy approach to things like SIL is to start out by cowboying it. Little planning, incomplete requirements, the lot. Then start working on making a solution. Code to a fairly loose standard, but with the idea that it will have to eventually be rock solid. \n\nThis might even be in something like python.\n\nThe idea is to discover what isn't known; this will often inform a far better design, as well as requirements gathering. \n\nOther parts which go with this are great simulations. This way the cowboy built system can interact with a simulation and you can see it working and realize where major useability flaws might be.\n\nThen, once that is nailed down, it is far less onerous to do a proper V shaped process as most of it is now cribbing from the entirely complete and working system. \n\nThis way, there is a much lower chance of some kind of usability flaw which decreases safety, and there is also a much lower cost to doing the whole process. \n\nIf you look at the manpower requirements for even doing a light switch to SIL-3, I would suggest that it would take no fewer than 15 people. But something even as complex as a level crossing could be cowboyed by 2 or 3 people in a much shorter time. \n\nThe following SIL process will then still take 15+ people, but in a tiny fraction of the time; which not only results in a better product, but; if once deployed, an emergent safety issue were to appear, the process to fix it will be far cheaper by repeating the cowboy first process.\n\nI would also argue that a larger more onerous process has other human flaws:\n\n* If someone gets a gut feeling that they have built a problem, they are less likely to bring this up, simply because they don't want to wear this. I'm not talking about a provable issue, but something like the level crossing being way too prone to dropping into a safe state. Even if they do bring it up, a manager might be keen on shutting them down as the project is probably already late and over budget.\n\n* Sometimes there will be a far more advanced, and superior solution which overcomes other issues. But it is so complex that it might not be as testable to a \"proper\" level. ML is going to become a huge issue for safety critical systems. I can't see a way to create a certified system which relies in any way on ML. Yet, the ML may be able to do things which are far safer than not doing them. For example, flying. I genuinely do not believe there is any set of mathematically provable algorithms which can replace a pilot. But, as ML advances, like self driving, there will come a point where ML can fly a plane far safer than any human. To insist upon the same standards as we typically use today for ML will simply block ML; so something will have to give. Many of the underlying systems will still be super classic hard core; but take this Toronto crash. There is no having a human in the loop for ML to step in and prevent that. It would appear the pilots just didn't flare for whatever reason. The ML would have to just step in and take control; not a warning, not some stick shaking; just take over. \n\nThis last is where I foresee some interesting battles. Most people who are behind certification bodies, etc see the world as statistical. They are happy for others to come up with rules which might be old wives' tales, or not, but they are looking for numbers which are real and they are looking for lots of them. They like things where they can show millions or billions of in use hours. But, sometimes some engineers come along with something so much better it creates huge fights. They will show that some kind of certified system is actually pretty bad, and that something new is far better. There are some short fights, and then it all changes; the problem being often only after people die. Getting carbon fiber into aircraft is still being fought. People argue that the FEA is harder, or that the processes for assembly aren't nailed down, etc. But, it is an excellent material is not in question. \n\nBasically, common sense needs to be a huge part of moving forward, and that pedantry is a great way to create super safe systems which aren't.\n\nAn excellent example of this is in the OPs comments on the mars helicopter. He said, good code>shiny hardware.\n\nBut, that thing crashed because it was confused by featureless terrain. I'm fairly certain my DJI drone does not get so easily confused; I am also fairly certain my DJI drone doesn't have wildly better processing power, but probably just a bit better. The key being that in their quest for perfect, they probably had to forego good.\n\nYet, while DJI is pretty damn battle tested code, I suspect that it would not pass NASA anything.\n\nHe also mentions apollo code; again; that buggy code was screaming errors the whole way to the moon's surface; impressive that it did what it did, but it wasn't rock solid by any modern standard. A better example might have been the space shuttle; If I understand correctly it had few or zero bugs in operation.", "author": "LessonStudio", "score": 0}

Technically you can do it directly in the server component but it’s not the RSC itself, it’s just where you place your data access code.

This way you have the same data access logic shared between the server rendered page component and an API route that exposes the same data to both the Next.js frontend and any external consumer that hits the API endpoint.

{"id": "madb2u0", "body": "End-to-end software test automation has traditionally struggled to keep up with development cycles. Every time the engineering team updates the UI or platforms like **Salesforce** or **SAP** release new updates, maintaining test automation frameworks becomes a bottleneck, slowing down delivery. On top of that, most test automation tools are **expensive** and **difficult to maintain**.\n\nThat’s why we built an **open-source AI-powered testing agent**—to make end-to-end test automation **faster, smarter, and accessible** for teams of all sizes.\n\n**High level flow:**\n\nWrite natural language tests -> Agent runs the test -> Results, screenshots, network logs, and other traces output to the user.\n\n**Installation:**\n\n    pip install testzeus-hercules\n\n**Sample test case for visual testing:**\n\n    Feature: This feature displays the image validation capabilities of the agent    Scenario Outline: Check if the Github button is present in the hero section     Given a user is on the URL as  https://testzeus.com      And the user waits for 3 seconds for the page to load     When the user visually looks for a black colored Github button     Then the visual validation should be successful\n\n**Architecture:**\n\nWe use AG2 as the base plate for running a multi agentic structure. Tools like Playwright or AXE are used in a REACT pattern for browser automation or accessibility analysis respectively.\n\n**Capabilities**:\n\nThe agent can take natural language english tests for UI, API, Accessibility, Security, Mobile and Visual testing. And run them autonomously, so that user does not have to write any code or maintain frameworks.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nHercules is a simple open source agent for end to end testing, for people who want to achieve insprint automation.\n\n1. There are multiple testing tools (Tricentis, Functionize, Katalon etc) but not so many agents\n2. There are a few testing agents (KaneAI) but its not open source.\n3. There are agents, but not built specifically for test automation.\n\nOn that last note, we have hardened meta prompts to focus on accuracy of the results.\n\nIf you like it, give us a star here: [https://github.com/test-zeus-ai/testzeus-hercules/](https://github.com/test-zeus-ai/testzeus-hercules/)", "author": "Unhappy-Economics-43", "score": 1}

{"id": "m1fr5ic", "body": "**Brief overview:**\n\nThe article discusses the inherent trade-offs in clustering algorithms, drawing a parallel to the CAP theorem in distributed systems. It references Jon Kleinberg's 2002 proof that no clustering algorithm can simultaneously satisfy scale invariance, richness, and consistency. The author explains each property: scale invariance ensures clustering remains unchanged under uniform scaling of distances; richness allows the algorithm to produce any possible partition of the data; and consistency means that tightening intra-cluster distances or widening inter-cluster distances should not alter the clustering outcome. The article emphasizes that practitioners must prioritize which properties are most critical for their specific applications, as achieving all three is mathematically impossible.\n\nIf the summary seems inacurate, just downvote and I'll try to delete the comment eventually 👍\n\n[^(Click here for more info, I read all comments)](https://www.reddit.com/user/fagnerbrack/comments/195jgst/faq_are_you_a_bot/)", "author": "fagnerbrack", "score": 5}

If you’re looking at a half scale height database, you’re probably thinking it’s about kids, and a double scale height probably looks very queer indeed.\n\nThe clustering cap theorem seems to assume that scale variance is simply inherent to a dataset.\n\nI wonder what happens if scale variance is one of the fundamental variables. Does this CAP theorem still hold?", "author": "CreationBlues", "score": 1}
{"id": "m1kqc92", "body": "Kleinberg's proof is very nice, but I don't fully accept that any clustering algorithm must meet the axioms he provides. While they sound good, they can be combined in ways that really do violate what we intuitively think of as good clustering results. Let me provide two examples.\n\nSuppose we have uniformly distributed set of points in 2D. By richness we expect that assigning every point to its own cluster to be valid (they are all essentially independent, being is a uniform grid). By scale invariance I can shrink the grid of points down so the distances between them are epsilon. By consistency I can move the points anywhere as long as I only increase the distances between them -- which is easy as we shrunk the distances to be very small. Since we only applied transformations according to the axioms the clustering must remain the same. And yet I can produce any arbitrary arrangement of data, as clearly clustered into groups as a like.\n\nWe can go the other way as well. Start with the same uniform grid, but have every point in a single cluster (again, reasonable). By consistency I can move the points however I like as long as only decrease in distance. By scale invariance I can rescale them back to the original scale. Thus I can again produce an arbitrary arrangement with transforms allowed by the axioms that must therefore preserve clustering ... and yet clearly a different clustering can be desirable for different arrangements.\n\nFinally by applying combinations of these basic transforms (locally on a single cluster; globally among clusters) we can essentially produce almost any rearrangement we like. Clearly the axioms are asking for rather too much, and I don't consider them reasonable. I think the real culprit here is consistency -- *any* transform that increases inter-cluster distances and shrinks intra-cluster distances is too much to allow as it provides for arbitrary rearrangement within clusters, or amongst clusters (up to appropriate rescaling, as provided by scale invariance). I think you need a stricter axiom than that, and I suspect that such an axiom would not provide enough leverage to get a nice theorem.", "author": "lmcinnes", "score": 1}

{"id": "dlvor5a", "body": "Hi, the philosophy behind the project, (as well as how the project relates to libGDX, jMonkey), is explained in the [Wiki](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL/wiki/Introduction). There's also a [Contribution](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.\n\nWhilst your questions are answered in the Wiki in full, here's a short summary.\n\nFXGL is a stepping stone before moving to libGDX and primarily aimed at the educational environment. It started off as a collection of game development tutorials on YouTube. Then the codebase for tutorials grew and started to make a collection of modules. I compiled modules together and it became a library. After adding an application layer to the library, it became a framework. In its current state the framework makes use of real-world game development techniques inspired by open source game engines. If you do get a chance to try it out, your feedback would be greatly appreciated.", "author": "AlmasB0", "score": 2}

Meanwhile, the argument you were responding to was saying that not only are there other definitions that makes sense, but that the definition that makes the *most* sense doesn't even have a built-in notion of an inferior (e.g. slave, apprentice) and that it shows up an areas where \"master-slave\" terminology has been less prevalent than computers.\n\nIn this sense, while certain people probably thought of that definition all along (that's certainly closer to how I thought of it), the solution could just be that documentation, messages, etc. emphasize that definition of master. In the end, as they were learning git 90% of people probably haven't thought twice about what the underlying definition of master was they were probably too busy learning what the definition in this particular context would be. So, we're probably in a pretty good place to frame master in the way that we want rather than having to battle a bunch of people who think of it as meaning one thing or another.", "author": "CreativeGPX", "score": 1}

But even if we did, outside of the extreme case where they blatantly and outwardly meant to emphasize the slavery of sentient beings, what they meant doesn't really matter. The terminology and its meaning is long out of their hands. It's a convention that tons of people and programs have adopted and, in doing so, every time they use the word \"master\" in that context, they are contributing to the nuance of what it means. The people maintaining the use and definition of \"master\" in this context (the programming masses) have nothing to do with what some developer years ago thought as a metaphor and I think it's clear that through their use, its meaning has virtually nothing in common with the \"slave\" metaphor.\n\nI think that's what people who offer alternative metaphors for \"master\" are getting at. ... That right now, the people using the word have no reason to think about the master-slave metaphor and arguably for most people the underlying metaphor never crosses their mind. Because there are other metaphors that are arguably more intuitive for master today in the context of git and many people think in those terms and because it has evolved so far as to arguably have its own meaning and not really be a metaphor at all to most people, it's wrong for people to imply that master inherently refers to master-slave. So, I think a lot of times it's less that \"everybody means master as in the record industry 'master' copy\" or \"everybody means master as in master-apprentice\", it's more just to suggest that the burden of proof is on people who are complaining about the master-slave metaphor to show that's what is generally meant when we say \"master\" today because the abundance of alternative metaphors/meanings means there's no particular reason that it should have to mean that.", "author": "CreativeGPX", "score": 2}

The easiest way to do something in PHP is often the worst way to do it, leading to random, hard to fix crashes and wide-open security leaks.\n\nThe cause of all this is that Rasmus Lerdorf, creator of PHP wasn't a programmer (he didn't consider himself to be a programmer at the time he \"designed\" PHP), much less someone with knowledge about language design. That meant PHP was shoddy to begin with, which meant that a disproportionally large part of PHP's users are novices. Those novice users often picked up rather bad programming habits, both because PHP's inherent badness encouraged the bad programming, and because they learned from other novice programmers, rather than more experienced programmers. This leads to three things: 1) lots of really, really bad PHP code in the wild (both in production code, and in \"helpful\" code snippets on blogs) 2) a growing disdain for both PHP and the surrounding culture with other programmers 3) a vicious cycle, drawing in even more novice programmers and alienating expert programmers.\n\nBecause language maintainers usually draw from the pool of their language's users for new blood, this means... well, you can figure out what that means for PHP's maintainers.\n\nI think an important cause for PHP's improvement the last few years, is that many of it's early novice users have \"grown up\" and become better programmers --- and decided to use that expertise they have gained to help improve PHP, because we humans are nostalgic beings and we're irrationally attached to our first programming language (I guess this goes for me as well, with Python).", "author": "robin-gvx", "score": 7}

{"id": "go06jwc", "body": "There are a few good reasons to do a rewrite in Rust. \n\n1. Security: Rust makes it much harder to have memory issues. Microsoft said ~70% of security bugs in Windows are related to unsafe memory usage. \n2. Bringing new developers in: I’ve worked on old C projects. They are not great to navigate through. Cargo (and by extension rust) enforce more modern sensibilities with regard to project structure, meaning that a new developer can figure out where stuff is much more easily. Rust is also, I would argue, easier to learn than learning C to the point you can produce similar quality code. \n3. Maintainability: Simply with rust being a more modern language, it has a more extensive standard library. Many operations have a similar feeling to Python. This means that you don’t need as many utility functions to wrap common operations. This results in someone being able to pick up Rust code and generally figure out what it is doing. This is very important because a hard to maintain OS project is probably on life support. \n4. Speed: Rust is in the same speed class as C and C++ (it even uses a major C/C++ compiler as it’s backend). This means that a Python or Node project moved to Rust will be much faster. \n5. Compatibility: Since Rust is C ABI compatible, anything that can talk to C (almost everything) can talk to Rust. This makes an OS project in Rust can be used as a Python or Node module, or you can use it in you Java project, or it can be compiled to WASM and used to do things in the browser. Take, for instance, Python’s Scapy. Scapy is one of the best packet manipulation and creation programs out there, but it’s in Python.

GNOME's librsvg took this approach.\n\nSimilarly, a partial rewrite of just the security critical components of a library or application can follow the same procedure.

{"id": "c14uuke", "body": "It's great that people want to help OSS projects, but I don't think 'raiding' is a great framework for doing so.\n\nRegarding feature patches: no decent programmer is going to commit a big patch without first understanding it, vetting it for bugs, architectural compatibility and consistency with the project's long-term goals. So factor in a wait of a few weeks just to get your patch examined. A patch written by someone unfamiliar with the codebase is highly unlikely to be accepted first go. You'll be asked to justify choices, and might be asked to rewrite the patch. Will you be around to do this?\n\nRegarding bug fixes: if a bug report exists in a bug database, very likely the project owner has seen it. That means it probably isn't 'shallow' or easy to fix. Probably it requires some architectural rethought. This requires deep grokking of the codebase, which 'raiders ' are unlikely to have. See also my previous point about the difficulty of getting such changes in.\n \n> people without the technical skills required could participate by providing documentation\n\nGood tech writing is IMO harder than coding. It requires intimate familiarity with the software, a broad knowledge of what docs are _already_ out there, an understanding of where users are coming from, and good writing skills. Very few people have that combination of experience, user empathy, technical and writing skills. What are a gaggle of newbies likely to produce? Most likely, bad documentation, which in my view is worse than _no_ documentation.\n\nIMHO, if you want to help with coding, recognise that OSS projects are about people as much as about the codebase, and that code without a maintainer is worthless. Stick with a project and really learn how it works. Do the hard yards of earning the trust of the maintainers, and become a commiter.  If you want to improve the docs, write blog posts documenting your experiences. It helps users while being clearly unofficial.

It's a great idea; attending some of those raids should give any programmer quite some insight in various apps.\n\nInstead of taking up on the complete project, we can take upon part(s) of a project. That way we limit the scope, and we can pick parts that need development. \n\nOne way we can approach this is to write a guide beforehand. This serves two purposes: First and foremost, it's to inform any raider into the important parts of the system. Secondly, the guide, if well written and compliant with the doc standard at th project, can be included into the doc project. Any other new programmer joining after we raided the project will be able to \"get into\" the project with just the same speed as any RedditRaider. \n\nThe guide needs to cover the topics necessary to get a fair understanding of the architecture of the part we want to raid. For instance, if we want to take upon a library which is itself comprised of several (sub)libs, we pick a sublib to take on. The guidewriter then gives a general overview of the architecture (folder structure, important classes/functions, hierarchy of classes). Then, classes/functions are explained in \"overview mode\", quickly giving the functionality it implements and the purpose it serves, along with important details of those functions/classes. From here it mostly dpnds on what needs to get done, or the project type being taken upon. It might be a good solution to link to docs/classes/functions in order to get a detailed grip of the system. It might be that a new class structure is needed, or whatever is necesary at the last stage in the guide to get any (moderately skilled) Redditor to understand the project as much as needed to write code/make contributions in other ways.\n\nPicking the right projects, and then the right subprojects becomes an important part. A well written guide should be able to get a coder quite some understanding in about an hour, add another 1-2 hours for actual code viewing. So to write the first line of code, it should take about 2-3 hours in total.\n\nTL;DR: Pick project, pick part of project, Chosen One writes guide beforehand so any RedditRaider can write code in about 2-3 hours.", "author": "Ruudjah", "score": 2}

It has [67% branch coverage as of April 25](http://labs.twistedmatrix.com/2010/04/twisted-test-suite-code-coverage.html)! And thus can not start using the 2to3 tool. To many people this is one of the most important roadblocks in getting their projects over to Python 3.  A function assigned to a group of people with at least one leading exploration can get useful regression tests written within hours if not minutes.

Developers need to spend considerable amounts of time on coordinating their efforts and at some point it becomes just not worth it.\n\nWhat kind of power you want to concentrate? It is rarely that typing is a limiting factor. Usually developer just needs to spend some amount of time on understanding the problem and the fix, and putting more developers will not help with this.\n\nBut I think raid form will help with concentrating interest and attention. Indeed, if you make it a week-long event a lot of people will just procrastinate till the end of week and just do nothing. \n\nIf it is short then people just won't have time to procrastinate -- if it is just one night you're either in or out. Also it makes this activity more like fun and less like work. And social factor is a huge thing -- often people are too bored to work with code for a longer time, but if they are constantly communicating with others they will have better motivation.\n\nWhy not combine a 'raid' kind of event for getting attention and interest with a longer coding sessions? \n\nI see it like this: a raid is announced, at some time pre-made materials (howtos, tutorials, plans etc) are released, people gather on IRC and start discussing it with each other. If some small bugs can be fixed within that short time frame it is awesome.\n\nBut people should also discuss how they can fix larger issues and at the end of raid night they should have at least some plan -- who does what and how. Initial raid adds momentum -- people have already invested their time to get familiar with the project and they can continue hacking on it. So make it a week of hacking, for example.\n\nNo need to shut down IRC activity, but of course there will be less people communicating than on raid's night. But perhaps they'll have more meaningful communications as only ones who are really interested will stay.\n\nAnd if people have a certain time frame to do fixes -- say, a week -- it will keep them organized and motivated.\n\nMake another \"finishing\" raid in a week -- discuss progress, fix pending issues (at this time people should be more familiar with the project so it is easier), discuss further long-term collaboration if needed.\n\nThis way:\n\n * you have raid events for social interactions and attention concentration\n * people have time to do bigger/more complex fixes\n * there is a feel of accomplishment and competition because it is an event with a certain time frame", "author": "killerstorm", "score": 7}

Your function promises to do one thing, but it also does other hidden things. Sometimes it will make unexpected changes to the variables of its own class. Sometimes it will make them to the parameters passed into the function or to system globals. In either case they are devious and damaging mistruths that often result in strange temporal couplings and order dependencies.\n\n----\n\n> Functions should either do something or answer something, but not both.

These services are also added as the population and building densities increase.This growth is not without pain. How many times have you driven, bumper to bumper through a road “improvement” project and asked yourself, “Why didn’t they build it wide enough the first time!?”But it couldn’t have happened any other way. Who can justify the expense of a six-lane highway through the middle of a small town that anticipates growth? Who would want such a road through their town?It is a myth that we can get systems “right the first time.” Instead, we should implement only today’s stories, then refactor and expand the system to implement new stories tomorrow.

In an effort to make our classes and methods small, we might create too many tiny classes and methods.

Consider, for example, a coding standard that insists on creating an interface for each and every class. Or consider developers who insist that fields and behavior must always be separated into data classes and behavior classes. Such dogma should be resisted and a more pragmatic approach adopted.Our goal is to keep our overall system small while we are also keeping our functions and classes small.

Git (or version control in general really) is so core to the development process, it's never too early to learn. Not only that, but once you're able to reliably use git you're much more likely to take risks and try new things which is *vital* to learning to really program beyond the most basic stuff. Git hugely enables creative and divergent thinking.\n\nI've mentored a bunch of people from 0 knowledge. When they start it's always just the programming basics. At this stage they often get stuck on the basics and never move beyond tutorial hell... since whenever they try something on their own they run into errors and get discouraged. Usually at this point I introduce git. Once they start to really grasp it, the fear of trying new things while programming (and paralysis when seeing errors) is all but eliminated and rate of learning skyrockets. They're almost instantly confident enough to actually try building things rather than copy-paste code.\n\nI don't start with git right away simply because new programmers really struggle to see the value in it and get annoyed they aren't just programming yet.

{"id": "cj7trpi", "body": "No, there is an enormous difference between real-time sound synthesis and live coding. Although many of those languages were conceived while imagining how they would be used in live scenarios (SuperCollider and ChucK have REPL-like interaction models after all), that has never been the *main* focus. ChucK's gimmick is its handling of time inside the language, and it really is an innovative time model (it was Ge Wang's Ph.D. thesis if I'm not mistaken).\n\nThe paradigm ChucK lives in, in terms of usability of programming in a live context, is not very different from SuperCollider which was almost 10 years old when ChucK became mature enough to be used by people other than its author. You simply type your methods, use instantiation, interact with stuff with setters and getters and so on.\n\nSorensen's work, in contrast, exploits functional programming semantics for live code manipulation and in my observation everything is built around this idea.  In this system, the line between code and data is very blurry. The piece of code you are editing live is the very code that is being iterated at that second in a loop. You are not setting global state with setters and getters. All the numeric data in the code you are editing become something akin to sliders or knobs in a Digital Audio Workstation GUI. They are not stored as global state that you manipulate by external means, you manipulate the data directly while you are editing the code. A LOT less friction compared to the other mentioned languages.\n\nAgain, you can set up similar environments within SuperCollider or ChucK, but it would be a forced process, because the languages / libraries were not designed with that modality in mind. And nothing is stopping you from using impromptu or extempore in a more imperative style during a performance. \n\nI'm just talking about what the design of those systems signify by their default *attitudes*.

Some licenses transfer almost all rights (BSD/MIT-style) and others with limitations (GPL-style).\n\nLimiting the rights of the original author isn't commonly something done, but I guess foundations could use it to ensure their communities can trust them perpetually. So for that kind of scenario, it's a smart idea *as long as it doesn't fragment the community*. If it prevents sharing of code between projects, it is bound to be more friction than it is worth. The licensing jungle is already complex enough that I have to disregard almost anything non-BSD/MIT.\n\nAlso, copyleft licenses rely on copyright law being somewhat uniform across countries. I'm guessing there is less uniformity for this sort of meta-copyright thing you're suggesting.\n\nAlso, avoid signing copyrighted contracts unless it states that you are allowed to share it with lawyers, in court, with journalists (except NDA-like stuff ofc.)

I just started a new job, and their newly written code base makes me want to tear my hair out. Could you C++ guys give me your opinions on these issues, and mention your professional experience for context?\n\nAm I being a dinosaur complaining about these things? I really need to know! The explanation for every item is \"unit tests\" or \"shortens build time\".\n\n* Project is about 6 man-years of code, but has hundreds of individual project files. Maybe 40% of them are unit test targets, and most of the rest are DLL targets. These DLLs are all required to even start the application. Files in these projects are carefully sorted into directories so that there are rarely more than 6 files in any given directory. One project would typically have 3-4 subdirectories. Whenever I need to move files to another project (as happens when making changes), I have to very carefully move it in projects and source control, in the project files, update DLL exports, update #include paths for other projects, and update linker dependencies. Is this the new normal??\n* Every member function is virtual. Many classes derive from an ABC, and are referred to via ABC pointers, exclusively for unit testing. There are only two classes who derive from these ABCs, the mock and the real class. These ABC pointers are passed in constructors, rather than trivially created because \"unit tests\". I can't inspect these ABC pointers in the debugger, sometimes not even with casting magic. My coworkers rely entirely on unit tests rather than debugging. Is this normal?\n* Most classes have pImpl implementations. Even the ABC derived classes have pImpl. It only doubles the amount of code for trivial classes. Is everyone doing this now?\n* We strictly adhere to 1 class per file. Even small, closely bound classes are separated into different files, and often different directories or even DLLs. I've been told to break up 200 line CPP files. Should I expect this everywhere?\n* Classes are only referred to via boost::shared_ptr. We never use weak pointers or raw pointers, only shared pointers. That's fine, except that there's no clear ownership of objects. Classes which might rationally own these objects don't even store pointers to them, and they end up de-facto owned by some unexpected classes, often with circular shared_ptr ownership. So long as we don't care about closing every handle and deleting every object, this kind of works because we use:\n* Signals. We use a lot of boost::signals. With boost signals I can't see who has signed up for a signal in my debugger. I don't see it by inspecting the object, and the emit site is about 20 stack levels away from the slot (really!). The only way to find listeners is to search my code for registrations. Is this common in the industry?\n\nMy main complaint is that none of my tools can grok this code. Doxygen generates worthless output because it can't follow the connections. My debugger can't show me program state. This code was written for unit tests and that's the only tool that works. My coworkers believe in this (they wrote it!) and I can't convince them otherwise (I tried!). So give me some advice.\n\nAm I a dinosaur who needs to adapt, or are my coworkers drinking the unit test koolaid?\n\nPlease upvote even if you hate this question, because I need answers.

In the TDD community, they're likely to view debugging as ad-hoc, one-off, exploratory unit-testing.  Rather than fight off unit testing, I'd say give it a go.  Whatever it is you're trying to ask the debugger, ask the same question in a unit test.

{"id": "c4kbxwk", "body": "So I'm late to the party, but I want to say a few things that disagree with a large number of the replies, so here goes.\n\nFirst, my background: I designed a popular casual game SDK, used in over a hundred published games, and I've been doing video game programming for over 20 years. I first used C++ in 1989, well before there was a standard, or templates, or even working compilers on most game systems, though I didn't start using it in earnest until later in the 90's. I have a strong OOD background, but feel like I've gone beyond that into multiparadigm programming -- IMO different tools are best for different jobs. I'm typically *the*, or one of the few, C++ \"experts\" where ever I've worked, and while working on that SDK I've helped hundreds of people debug their own apps through its user forums, where I've observed code written by many, many developers, and frequently was able to diagnose problems with only a few hints as to the behavior.\n\nCaveat: I may be a dinosaur too. ;)\n\nWith that said:\n\n* IMO, where unit tests shine most are:\n\n   * In dynamic languages where you typically don't have compile-time type and parameter checking. If you don't have full coverage with unit tests, really basic errors that would be caught by a compiler can be tracked down with unit tests.\n   * In code that maps well to a \"functional\" programming paradigm. For instance, you're calculating something, and you expect the code to produce specific results. If this describes the code you're working on, then unit tests are completely appropriate, but...\n\n* On the other hand, unit tests shouldn't take away from your ability to use best practices, including stepping through your code with a debugger. I created a test suite covering several aspects of the library I was developing without making every member function virtual (in games we actually care about performance...) and without destroying the ability to cleanly debug code. I based the unit tests on CppUnit, though with my own extension/test definition language that allowed me to write tests without all the extra framework boilerplate.\n\n* I don't care what unit test supporters say: Being able to step through code in a debugger is a *powerful* way to grok the code. If you're a unit test fan, then great: Let it inspire you to write new tests. If unit tests are harming your ability to debug, then you've got a bad unit test framework/architecture.\n\n* Small project files, in general, is nice. One file per class, in general, is nice (with notable exceptions -- a separate file for each 2-line struct seems like overkill to me). \n\n* Sorting everything into subdirectories is...a bit OCD, and unless your tools are particularly good at finding files, sounds like it would be more of a problem than a benefit. I've used libraries that have a somewhat logical layout in a folder hierarchy, and due to inherent problems in ontology, I often end up having to dig through many folders (or simply grep) to find the file I'm looking for. \n\n* Pimpl is a great pattern for a few situations: Say you have a cross-platform library where the class implementation needs to be fundamentally different for each target platform. Or you have some kind of proprietary algorithm that you don't want users of your library to even see slight hints of its implementation. Using it on just about any other class indicates to me the same abovementioned OCD. Or alternately you're working with a group of people who worship at the altar of the GoF without really understanding *when* it's appropriate to use each pattern, which is almost worse.\n\n* shared_ptr is great, and if you're using it for a class, you should only ever use a smart pointer to refer to that class (i.e. mixing smart and raw pointers is a bad idea). That said, weak_ptr exists for a reason. Also, I frown upon any code that can't exit with *zero* memory leaks, so weak_ptr is really essential in any smart pointer strategy. And...I don't use smart pointers for absolutely every class, because they're not always appropriate.\n\n* Signals are a cool pattern, but I haven't used boost::signals, and with your description, I probably never will. Honestly most of the code I write these days that needs callbacks I do from a scripting language (Lua) that ultra-simplifies handling such callbacks, and when I need to use C++, then I use the standard observer pattern with an abstract observer base class. Looks like the boost::signals method is easier to code, which is good, but I consider it broken to not be able to observe the state of the program in the debugger.\n\n* And saving the worst for last: Breaking Doxygen, IMO, is a cardinal sin. \n\n> My coworkers believe in this (they wrote it!) and I can't convince them otherwise (I tried!). \n\nYour coworkers sound like they're ... how to say this delicately ... *not* veteran programmers? Or at least they come from Java/Ruby/Python/Perl shops, where unit testing is more of the norm. I come from smaller development teams of awesome developers, and where complete unit test coverage is not part of the religion.\n\n> So give me some advice.\n\nThe C++ job market is hot right now. Casually look around for saner coworkers? Personally I'd not be happy working in the conditions you describe. You just need to figure out what's more important: Using the tools you've spent many years honing your skills in, or throwing that away to work on a code base where you can't utilize the full breadth of your talents. \n\nI've had a job where the match wasn't so good, and the result wasn't pretty.

You can quickly recompile one part of the system, and it forces you to separate your concerns into modules, which is good design.\n\nWith unit tests you always need to find a balance between 1) how much work it takes to maintain the tests, vs 2) how much benefit they provide. It's possible that their balance is leaning too far towards (1), but hey, what price can you put on sanity?\n\n> Every member function is virtual.\n\nThis seems fine, why worry about it?\n\n> Most classes have pImpl implementations. Even the ABC derived classes have pImpl.\n\nThis is a good trick for reducing the number of recompilations. But, it seems like if they have already split up the code into lots of small projects, that also using pImpl is probably overkill. Whoever designed this code base was *really* worried about speed of recompilation.\n\n> Many classes derive from an ABC, and are referred to via ABC pointers, exclusively for unit testing.\n\nI've seen this approach before for really large projects, I think it's a fine way of doing things. It's writing code as if it was enterprise Java.\n\n> We strictly adhere to 1 class per file.\n\nSeems fine.\n\n> Classes are only referred to via boost::shared_ptr. We never use weak pointers or raw pointers, only shared pointers.\n\nThis seems like this would get annoying and unnecessary after a while, but it's not the worst idea ever. At least it's consistent.\n\n> Signals. We use a lot of boost::signals.\n\nAsynchronous message-passing is a pretty great way to architect a big system. It's a bummer that it doesn't mesh well with your existing tools, if I were you then I would think about writing some code that lets you peek inside the message queues (maybe write them all to a log file). Message-passing can lead to a highly introspectable and understandable system once you can actually see the messages that are flying around.\n\nIn general it seems like these things are fine. Keeping a large C++ codebase bug-free is a really hard task, so it's understandable to have to do a lot of grunge work to keep it that way. My advice is to embrace it and find alternatives for those tools you were hoping to use. Their decisions might not be perfect, but at least it sounds like the code is internally consistent, and consistency is very very good.

At least some of this should be automated. Should be as simple as moving the relevant source files -- I would think the rest of that should be automatic.\n\n> Every member function is virtual.\n\nWeird for C++, but normal in Java and in anything higher-level (Ruby, Python, Perl). Virtual functions are easy to reason about.\n\n> ...and are referred to via ABC pointers...\n\nShould at least be using smart pointers of some sort, right? And maybe an 'auto' here or there would lessen the pain?\n\nOther than that, this is mostly reasonable. If you're going to have a base class, it should be abstract, though it may make sense to create a single implementation concrete class first and only swap it out for an abstract base class when you have multiple implementations. Other than this, you usually don't want your code to be assuming anything more about an object's class than it has to.\n\nNot a very C++ thing, if the STL is any indication, but to take Java as an example, it's not just abstract, it's an *interface* that I stick to:\n\n    List<String> foo = new ArrayList<String>();\n\nThere is now nowhere else in my code which will break if I swap that ArrayList for a LinkedList.\n\n> I can't inspect these ABC pointers in the debugger, sometimes not even with casting magic.\n\nDon't know what to tell you here. Seems like this *should* be fixable with an appropriate debugger or appropriate compile-time flags.\n\n> Most classes have pImpl implementations. Even the ABC derived classes have pImpl. It only doubles the amount of code for trivial classes. Is everyone doing this now?\n\nI'm guessing \"no\". Like *many* things you've described, this carries a performance cost. But this also makes sense, and is standard practice in Java. That \"List<String>\" is a generic *interface,* which is basically a pimpl. ArrayList and LinkedList both share a common abstract base class, AbstractList, and there are other abstract classes along the way.\n\nThis is less needed in C++, which has multiple inheritance, but it's still valuable. The basic problem being solved here is that C++ (and Java, and basically every Class-oriented language ever) has conflated the concepts of *type* (and *interface*) with the practice of *code-sharing.* In Java, the rule of thumb is that you only ever use inheritance to share code -- otherwise, you use an interface.\n\nConsider that List example. It may seem obvious, if working with arrays, that all lists should have iterators that are simply pointers to the given value. This assumption changes, along with the *entire* implementation of a pointer, when you add a linked list -- it needs to store a pointer to a *node* instead, but the dereference operator should return the *value,* not the node.\n\nI suppose it depends what's meant by \"trivial\", though. I wouldn't use something like this for inline classes, or for classes only ever used in one source file, but there are a lot of places it makes sense, if you're going to use a statically-typed language.\n\n> We strictly adhere to 1 class per file. Even small, closely bound classes are separated into different files, and often different directories or even DLLs. I've been told to break up 200 line CPP files. Should I expect this everywhere?\n\nGood idea, but there are limits to this. Anonymous classes can often be a good thing. Small classes can (and should) be avoided for things like functors, when you can use a lambda instead, or *at least* an anonymous class.\n\n> Classes are only referred to via boost::shared_ptr. We never use weak pointers or raw pointers, only shared pointers. That's fine, except that there's no clear ownership of objects.\n\nThis would be fine, except:\n\n> ...they end up de-facto owned by some unexpected classes, often with circular shared_ptr ownership.\n\nSounds like maybe it's time to add a real garbage collector, like boehm-gc?\n\nI don't know much about signals, but reading the rest of your list, my interpretation is that these are mostly good ideas, taken a little too far, and that hopefully the solution is better tooling, rather than abandoning these ideas entirely. Unit tests are a good idea.\n\nOn the other hand, it also sounds like they'd be more comfortable in Java. At what point is C++ worth the effort? Not that this helps you now; if you can't get them to do more idiomatic C++, I doubt you'll be able to get them to switch languages entirely.\n\nAlso, if you can actually figure out how tools could grok this code, that might be the best possible way forward -- try to convince them to let you spend a small percentage of your time patching doxygen and friends, and release it as open source. You won't break the unit tests, but you'll add a ton more functionality.\n\nYou're half-right. You're *always* a dinosaur, you *always* need to adapt.

If R is so big and unweildy that I can't create it trivially or I'm only using a few functions from it, should it be broken up?  \n4. Ok, mock. This is pretty obvious when you rely on something like current time, random number generators, or databases).\n\nThe function passing approach is one not generally used by Java land since you can't pass first class functions, afaik.

ArrayList and LinkedList both share a common abstract base class, AbstractList, and there are other abstract classes along the way.\n\nThat's not a PImpl. A PImpl is the C++ attempt at [opaque pointers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer). The interface is defined in the header and the implementation is private so you can later add or remove fields without requiring a recompilation of the entire project. It's part of an ABI strategy and is important if they're using so many shared objects (or DLLs in Windows land) which get updated individually. That said, if they update everything in lock step, then it sounds like they're just cargo cult programming.\n\n>. Anonymous classes can often be a good thing. Small classes can (and should) be avoided for things like functors, when you can use a lambda instead, or at least an anonymous class.\n\nThere exist anonymous classes in C++, but I've never seen someone write one in the wild. I have seen people using anonymous structs in C. Anyway, to use a class with a template it needs external linkage, so you can't use anonymous classes for them anyway.

{"id": "c4kbzgh", "body": "> Unit testing forces the code to be organized in a non-intuitive way. This makes it harder for me to read and understand.\n\nYep.  It's a double-edged sword.  Unit testable code is hard to read and trace (partly) because nothing is responsible for creating any objects it depends on (because if it did, it would be a bitch to get the tests to use an alternate implementation), so you never quite know where things are coming from.\n\nOn the other hand, while it takes more time to follow the code, it creates a situation where code can't create its own dependencies, which can turn out to be beneficial because it makes the code more flexible.  It enforces some measure of good separation of responsibilities.\n\n> The unit test code itself adds a lot of complexity and LOC to the project.\n\nI'm not going to disagree with that.  I think you are *getting more* in exchange, but whether it's worth (say) twice as much code total is another question.  I'm not sure the benefit is linear in that if you double the lines of code by adding unit tests, I don't know that you get twice the total value out of the code.\n\n> The testing code has always been a huge hair-ball of setting up crazy states and testing edge-cases.\n\nSometimes there is a lot of grunge work in getting all these states set up.  Sometimes there's intrinsic complexity there (there's no way it can be made better), and sometimes it's extrinsic complexity (your code is *doing too much* -- seriously violating the [single responsibility principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)).  If it's intrinsic complexity, it may just be that that's the costs of getting tests written for that code.  If it's extrinsic complexity, it might mean your unit tests are telling you something about how unwieldy your code is.\n\nAs for edge cases, that's all a matter of what you want to achieve with the tests.  In some situations, testing every case might be worthwhile, say for example if bugs will cause the system to crash or the company to lose money.  In other situations, maybe the best thing to do is test the cases that matter most or the ones you feel are at greatest risk of having implementation issues.\n\n> The common argument that test code actually serves as documentation has not been true in my limited experience.\n\nIt depends.  On the one hand, unit tests are often the sloppiest code you'll see, with lots of copy/pasted code everywhere and a lot of other violations of style and good practice.  Those unit tests probably don't serve as very good documentation.  And unit tests don't automatically *become* documentation just because you wrote some methods that use a unit testing framework.\n\nOn the other hand, unit tests can be a good way of providing some documentation about interactions with external systems.  For example, suppose you are writing code that will import data files sent to you by some outside party.  If they give you docs on the file format, what values are legal in various fields and each value means, etc., you could write unit tests for your parser, and the unit tests could capture the rules they've sent you.  Now suppose the code has been running fine for a year when suddenly they send you a data file that your parser says is a bad data file.  If the unit tests cover that case, you can look at them and perhaps know that you are doing it that way because that's what they told you to do, so maybe the data file is bad and your parser is fine.  Or they changed the spec and forgot to tell you.  But at least your unit tests tell you whether you *intended* your parser to behave that way.

But you need a concrete type at some point, right? Otherwise it's not a very useful interface. Now if those concrete types are available to the users of your library in the header, then they can instantiate the type on the stack. This means they know the size and layout of the object at compile time and any changes to the size of the object will require a recompilation. This is bad for libraries which are very far upstream because you can't just distribute your .so and let everyone get the benefits of your patch; it means everyone would need to download your .so and all the other .so files which use it and a new version of every library. It's very costly for releasing a patch!\n\nThe ways around this are to prevent people from seeing the class implementation in a header (PImpl, opaque pointer, handle objects), or by preventing people from making the objects themselves (private constructor, factory friend which can instantiate on the heap for the user).

The former is preferred.\n\nThe latter seemed more obvious. Why is the former preferred?\n\nThe other advantage which seems obvious is when we want to allow the user to pass such an object to us. Take something like std::for_each. Right now, it seems to do this with a lot of template magic, but it seems possible to have a function like this which imposes some interface base class that these iterators and the associated functor must inherit from. In this case, the library is of course never going to see the concrete class, but will occasionally be passed pointers to a concrete implementation from a user of the library.\n\n> Finally, if you're not a library author and you don't mind forcing recompiles, then none of this matters and people who do this in their application are largely wasting their time for a practice they saw in Herb Sutter's articles and didn't really understand why.\n\nThis makes sense. It sounds like OP's company is trying to make a lot of things libraries, and to pre-emptively make everything a PImpl so they can avoid thinking about which of these are exposed across the library boundary. Not really an excuse, of course -- it also seems like without a solid idea (even if it changes) of what should and shouldn't be exposed, you're not going to have a very forward-compatible library anyway.", "author": "SanityInAnarchy", "score": 2}
{"id": "c4ktagx", "body": ">Right, this makes sense, but there are a lot of places such interfaces would be useful without ever exposing a concrete type across the API boundary...\n\nYes, it's very powerful. But it strikes me that if you are offering an abstract base class from which to inherit and no concrete types, the library doesn't know the type we've submitted so all it can do is call our functions as required. That sounds the API is basically a collection of callbacks which are implicitly registered by the nature of the class inheritance. Taking a step back, we could instead expose this as signals/slots or events/handlers at the function level and then have a the class based interface from which we inherit as a utility to register the event handlers for us. Doing it as function calls means C code can join the fun and make your ABI even more stable (no be bound to a single compiler vendor and clump of versions with consistent name mangling). And if C can join in, you can probably call this from any number of scripting languages with an almost trivial binding. Now your library is cooking with gas!\n\n>The latter seemed more obvious. Why is the former preferred?\n\nBy the latter, I merely meant making the constructor private but still letting users see the implementation in the header. This will still trigger recompilations if someone picks up the new header. So releasing a new patched version without triggering recompilations means convincing all your users to point their linker to the new version and keeping the includes pointing to the older version. That won't go down well. Also, all we've done is cover the possible bug vectors we can think of by preventing certain types of use that would break (accessing the layout, etc). It's possible that when implementing that, we made a mistake and people could use the size and the layout and when we update and they relink without recompiling, they get plenty of difficult to debug stack corruption. So I only added that option as a theoretical choice, not one that anyone should actually consider except to reason about the entire solution space of what they're doing. Which is what we need to do when we're designing a system without relying on cargo cult designs.\n\nMaking an opaque pointer means users really can't run into these types of problems with the ABI.

You could pass in a giant structure with pointers to each callback -- which is ultimately a poor-man's virtual table, so I don't see an advantage other than that it's accessible from C.\n\nCompared to these, signals/slots or events/handles seem much more complex, but I haven't really used these in C++.\n\nI see why we wouldn't want to give users a factory to construct these objects on the stack.

If you keep your changes/features small and there is nothing wrong with losing any additional context squashing them is a valid option.

Software Architecture is the most efficient way to transform all the things described above into something that everyone in the development team can understand. The reason a lot of documentation has to be created is to prevent any deviation from the requirements and in fact before releasing a component design it goes through several reviews, junior and senior software engineer included, mixed with system and software architects. In top of all this, once it is released and placed in the cars, if a failure is identified the amount of money that the development company would have to pay to reprogram this modules is humongous, also any error in critical systems could kill the user of the car. Most popular tool IBM rhapsody \n\nFrom my point of view, the companies mentioned in the blog, uses a SaaS bussines model, where the company will give you whatever they have determined is best for the market, and the final user will decided if it fits its needs.

I have done something of a study of them and you will find widely differing interpretations of them in more than a superficial way. \n\nIn studying the patterns i paid much more attention to the intent then any other part. For example, the intent of the factory pattern is:\n\n>Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.\n\nIt's accompanied by the following code:\n\n    Product* MyCreator::Create (Productld id) {     if (id == YOURS)  return new MyProduct;     if (id == MINE)   return new YourProduct;         // N.B.: switched YOURS and MINE if (id == THEIRS) return new TheirProduct;      return Creator::Create(id); // called if all others fail }\n\n  \nIts worth noting that each chapter has a section called \"Implementation\" that is usually 30% of the explanation, which is \\*followed\\* by code, known uses (examples) and related patterns. The Intent is usually a sentence or two the motivation might be a paragraph, and i recommend paying the most attention to this part, as it transcends examples and gets at the essence of the design.  T  \n\n\nAs a starting point, some languages don't even have an easy mapping from which to understand this pattern. Some functional languages reject the idea of Classes outright. Furthermore, the code is just a case statement, giving this a name isn't particularly helpful. Someone might argue that the factory pattern is more than this, but most examples i saw were just like this.   \n\n\nI would re-write the intent more generically as: Let the callers of a function decided what functionality to return.  \n\n\n In lisp, a higher order function can take an argument which is a function and return one. The inability to do this in many languages and the extra boilerplate that they have instead, is what facilities many of these patterns. Even Java has come a long way to making this type of work easier since the book was written.   \n\n\nI'm becoming worried that by and large the book is now getting recommended because its so heavy that few take the time to really read it, understand it or think deeply about why it is the way it is. It seems impressive, and it is, but not as a template for how to build modern systems, but more like a history lesson.

These APIs are in common usage as they make it possible to write safe, understandable and simple code in comparison to what you'd have to do without them. \n\nWithout those things from FP, even a simple filtering operation would require you to write a method that iterates through the list, applies the given filtering operation (which would have to be hardcoded or passed in as an object instance, possibly of an anonymous class, fulfilling an interface) and dumps matching objects into a collection of a specific datatype. With the Stream API, you simply write `dataList.stream().filter(x -> x.getSomething() == \"Hi!\").collect(Collectors.toList())`, and it does just what you can read in the code.

{"id": "g1lrhw7", "body": "The writer means well and is close to the mark, but I feel misses to one side when claiming that a goal should be to keep member variables or attributes of a class down to 7.\n\nThere is a variety of OOP that leads developers to focus on the class members (one that I see way too often in Python codebases, due to how Python handles classes, so it was only moderately surprising to see the author use Python in their examples..), but .. that .. really shouldn't be what you are focusing on in OOP.\n\nThe point of a class is functionality, not data. In fact, if you mostly are only seeing data in your classes, something is likely askew with the design. A class should provide a set of functionality in the form of an API that allows one to interact with a *concept*, whatever that may be (a network socket, a shipping entry, a file, an image in memory, a database connection ..).\n\nTo provide an actually useful interface, many such classes will necessarily have more than a handful of data members. This is often just fine.\n\nBut when the set of functionality (API) is poorly presented, lacks focus, provides no clear patterns of interaction, hides surprises behind calls (\"why does rename(string) clear out the id?\"), etc. then problems abound.\n\nThe real analog to the \"too many items to remember\" limit of the human brain is \"too many different topics in one place\". This *can* manifest itself as creating the need for an endless number of member variables. But that isn't itself diagnostic.\n\nIf the program has a \"god object\" with everything under the sun (or even one with more than once concept), it's going to be as evident a problem through its API as looking at its data members. If a class does too many things (even if somewhat related in topic), it will be visible in the API, even if the data members are manageable. Similar for other issues such as the naming of methods is inconsistent, or the data access patterns are so convoluted and inconsistent as to be \"impossible\" to reason about.\n\nOf course, classes can have other objects as members themselves, the exact solution the author reached for in their refactoring example. Does that now count as 1 data member, making everything better? Well, what if that object introduces its own convoluted API, resulting in code even more complex than if the containing class had more data members?\n\nSince classes often have objects as data members themselves, this ends up nesting quickly: a bad API design will make classes that use objects of that type more complex internally, regardless of data member count.\n\nThis is something seen regularly in larger codebases, and one ends up snaking through a forest of classes with \"interesting\" patterns of interaction. But hey, few private members, right?\n\nAlso, when OOP is done decently well, the data members do not \"leak\" out of the class. Only the API does. (FWIW: If your language does not guide you there, you are using a tool that is poor.) This means that for every time you must reason about the data members of a class, you will end up reasoning about the functionality of the class (via its API) far far more often. Keep that focused and clear, and keep the data needed to keep that running as simple as possible, as consistently named as possible, and as well-typed as possible, and there will be far fewer aggravating debug sessions than having \"too many\" data members. That is a more important measure of \"too complex for our limited human minds\" than counting how many ints or strings your class has as members.\n\nIt is not the number of data members (yes, there are exceptions, there always are), it is the API of the class.\n\nNow, you can certainly create implementations of classes that are horribly complex and are indeed, as the auther notes, just a badly designed structured program in disguise as a class.\n\nHowever, where the author again misses the point is that *all* classes with an API (i.e. not just a bundle of exposed data members masquerading as OOP) are structured programs \"in disguise\". It really has nothing to do with how many data members (even zero). \"Structured program\" is not a perjorative, it is just a different way (sometimes requiring more effort) of writing programs. Bad structured programs as bad, not all of them.\n\nSo while I understand what the author was getting at, and agree that code should be human-grockable before other attributes, I can not agree with the simplistic notion that one simply counts the number of data members as a signal of complexity.\n\nThe example they provided is a good example of a nice refactor but not for the reasons stated (\"8 members are too many\"). The reason it is an improvement is because the relationship between the data members was lost. They were not well collected into sensible concepts such as a timespan (btw, their naming of classes in the refactor was lackluster: Span? What is that? oooooh, a *time*span) and as a result code to manage those data members would have to be resident in the PerfEvent class rather than delegated to a time span class (which can probably find other uses in future..). \n\nOnce they had things down to 6 members, they were happy .. but should they have been? Hard to tell without seeing how the rest of the class is written and used int he program; depending on how the args are used, for instance, it may be useful to wrap those in a class as well that provides a nice API to fetching specific args, providing summaries or hashable keys representing them ... \n\nIt reminds me of a developer who once worked for me who had been trained that functions longer than 20-25 lines were \"too long\". This resulted in them writing function1 which would call function2 as its last instruction, which would in turn call function3 as its last instruction... and so on until they had destructured their 200 line monstrosity into 8 separate functions that simply called the next one. Oof.\n\nOdd ideas of what constitutes complexity, particularly overly simplistic ones, often lead to oddly constructed programs.", "author": "aseigo", "score": 19}

None of this really has anything to do with objects. You could achieve the same by just having a naming convention.\n\n        self.name = name\n        self.span_start_ns = start_ns\n        self.span_end_ns = end_ns\n        self.category = category\n        self.origin_process_id = process_id\n        self.origin_thread_id = thread_id\n        self.args = kwargs\n        self.phase = phase\n\nIn other words, you don't have to reduce the number of fields in an object to 7 in order to have that object be written in such a way that you only have to look at a little bit at once and can use concepts like chunking and hierarchy. I think, given the same inspiration as OP, I'd much rather write an object as follows than as OP did.\n\n        //Meta\n        self.name = name\n        self.category = category        \n        \n        //Timing\n        self.span_start_ns = start_ns\n        self.span_end_ns = end_ns\n        self.get_timespan() = ...\n        \n        //PIDs\n        self.origin_process_id = process_id\n        self.origin_thread_id = thread_id\n        \n        //Stuff I don't know how to classify because I don't know OP's program\n        self.args = kwargs\n        self.phase = phase\n\nIn that setup, it is a hierarchy and it does chunk like things together. But those things don't have to be their own objects unless abilities unique to objects start to become important. Putting similar things near each other is not a unique benefit of objects. Naming things through a dot-separated hierarchy is not unique to objects (i.e. use an underscore). When you start passing sets of things as a unit, needing to operate that unit in the same way across objects or want to benefit from inheritance, *then* it makes sense to use objects. Or when you're trying to protect an API pattern by making certain parts of the class private to other parts. And the examples OP gives may ultimately fit those needs, but don't rewrite them until it does. That's just a waste and adds complexity.", "author": "CreativeGPX", "score": 2}

{"id": "d629wie", "body": "Hmm! Good question! So, I don't think I can possibly give myself an overall score because I didn't go into the full breadth that I needed to. In 45 minutes I think the bare minimum things you would have to address are:\n\n* **At least some basic capacity estimation that is sane.** I think I did this at a passable level in this video, but only barely. The 68K number is still somewhat naive even based on what I explained. I took 245M and divided it by 360. That assumes second-to-second even distribution of log traffic, which is still unrealistic. I also said that we'd assume each person used the app for an hour. Of course, you won't be streaming log data non-stop for an hour, but you would have at least a few log data deliveries, most likely. My estimation doesn't account for this at all. Still, it's in the right ballpark, just not 10/10. That said, the reason I chose exactly this aspect to focus on is because in the 70 or so of these kinds of interviews I did at Facebook, capacity estimation was absolutely the weakest aspect of most people's performance. I wanted to make this video strongly emphasising it so people who watch it will have that first in mind. To that end, most of the *very* senior candidate I interviewed were awesome at capacity estimation. So, I think my overall score for myself on this dimension would be a 5/10. A stronger candidate than what I presented here would also talk about sampling. How many people do you *actually* need logs from? The naive answer is **all teh peuples**. The better answer is some stat sig subset, which I didn't get into at all. You *can* justify unsampled logs as a design choice, and for this problem I definitely think you must justify it if you go that way.\n* **Explain something about batch delivery of logs from the client.** I didn't do this at all in this video, so it's impossible to give myself a real score here. Basically, the 2/10 answer is \"just send every log every time there is one.\" That will keep the wireless antenna in constant awake state, that will waste tons of requests delivering tiny payloads, and will mean when the person is actually trying to use your app, they'll be competing against your logging infra. A passable 6/10 answer on this dimension at least chunks the logs into reasonable size packages and delivers them in moments where nothing else is going no. I think a 10/10 answer would talk about ways to piggyback the logs on other requests in a really compressed way such that delivering them costs almost nothing. That said, I'm not awesome at network engineering and traffic optimisation, so probably there's a person out there who would deliver a 10/10 that would make what I just suggested seem clunky and stupid.\n* **Talk through how to handle that many logs on the server.** I didn't address this at all. If you've got 70k people streaming 10s of KB of log data to \"the server\", that quickly becomes gigabytes of data per second. You can't write that to one machine. Even if you could, you'd fill the HD so fast, it would be done in minutes. So, you need to distribute. A 2/10 on this would just say \"use a lot of machines to store the data.\" A 6/10 (passable) answer would address how many machines and how to partition them such that you can guarantee availability when you need it. 6/10 would also have to address that these are just buffer machines and that they need to have their data scraped periodically and written to some sort of long-term storage. A 10/10 would address the full data life-cycle and talk about when log data goes away. For instance, it seems pretty obvious that 1 year old log data for some already-been-deleted feature is useless, but how do you bake that into the architecture of the system?\n* **Explain in detail the specific technologies that would be employed in each of the above components.** Again, I didn't do this at all. A 2/10 would be \"Use some Android and iOS open source library and then use like HDFS on the server.\" Not enough detail, no sense that the person actually knows how to put the pieces together. 6/10 would be something like: \"On the client, use a circular buffer on the client that can handle 30KB of buffered data, accept that we're going to see some data loss. At this size, we can probably just use a <specific data structure (maybe just a linked list)> of <specific data storage (maybe just strings)>. That choice will have <these> tradeoffs. On the server, we can probably use Apache Scribe as the log receiver service, but we'll need a bunch of machines all receiving data. We'll need another process to scrape the data and organize the timestamps into our long term storage. Maybe we can use something like <specific technology (maybe Hadoop)> as our long-term storage because it will give us a good interface onto the data.\" A 10/10 answer here would do all of the 6/10 stuff, but also look towards what happens as the systems grows and whether or not those choices will work long-term. A 10/10 would also discuss specific downsides of these choices and how we'd have to live with/compromise with our choices.\n* **At the end, explain what there still is to talk about.** Because we have *so* much to talk about so little time, it's going to end without covering everything. A 2/10 person will say, \"Hm... na, I think we're good,\" because they have no idea how much of the picture is missing. A 3/10 person will come up with random shit to do because they can tell there *should be* more to do. A 6/10 person will identify major components of the system that are missing. Failover? Disaster recovery? Versions of the client? Etc. A 10/10 person will have a prioritised list of things that are absolutely critical. Usually the 10/10 person will be a bit disappointed that they only got as far as they got when they had so many specific things that were still on their mind. It's ironic that the people who tend to perform the poorest have the least notion that it didn't go well, while the best performers feel like they were bounded by the rate of human communication and wish they had more time.\n\nHope that's helpful!", "author": "jgbbrd", "score": 3}

This is how spaghetti code starts.\n\nRegarding the actual implementation, the structure you're parsing the data into is extremely ugly. Unless I'm mistaken, `stave` is a 2 KiB block of memory initialised to -1, with data inserted sparsely into the first ~80 bytes. Then the program loops over the whole 2 KiB block and prints any values that aren't -1.\n\nImprovements I'd like to see:\n\n**Remove useless comments**\n\nRemove comments that mindlessly reiterate exactly what a line of code is doing; basically every comment from line 88 to the end of main.c.\n\ne.g.\n\n    /* load the next character from the file */\n    note = getc(f);\n\nNo shit.\n\n\n**High-level documentation**\n\nAdd high level documentation explaining the purpose of the program.

If simple you could also explain to me the basic concepts of notes and staves etc. so I can verify that the program does indeed work :)\n\n**Parse into a real data structure**\n\nInstead of hacking your data into a huge free-form byte buffer, parse it neatly into an appropriate data structure. In this case I believe a linked list would be a good choice, as you need to add new items to the middle of the list as you scan each line of the input.\n\n**Separation of concerns**\n\n`main()` currently 'concerns' itself with the following:\n\n* Parsing CLI args\n* Initialising variables / data structures\n* Opening a data file\n* Parsing data\n* Formatting and printing output to the user\n\nAnd these are all intertwined like spaghette bolognese. What would you do if later you wanted to parse and compare the contents of 2 files? Copy/paste? Wrap another loop around your parsing loop? Things would get messy fast.\n\nI'd expect `main()` to look not much more complicated than this:\n\n    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n        char *filename = parse_args(argc, argv);\n        staves_t *staves = parse_file(filename);\n        print_staves(staves);\n    }\n\nAlthough this glosses over the pain of error handling in C.\n\nNote that `parse_file()` returns a (hopefully well documented) data structure that can be handed off elsewhere.

(Honestly, you should have made that more obvious - intending no disrespect, I have time to do a quick, impromptu code review, but not enough time to watch a 33 minute video this morning - sorry!)\n\nAnyway, some thoughts:\n\n* As many have said, your main() function is too long, and really should be split up into smaller functions.  \n* You assume that all guitar tabs use the same tuning for each string.  (Although you had a comment here about this one, so you at least considered it.)\n* You allocate a lot more memory than you're likely to need, and then don't even use all of it.  (You have a lot of holes in the middle that never get set.)  Using a better data structure would help here, although I understand that you might not have wanted to implement one just for this challenge.  \n* You have a lot of places where invalid input would cause something to break badly.  \n  * If there were ever more than 6 strings, you'd get array overruns.\n  * If any note were more than 2 digits long (i. e. using more than the 100th fret) you'd overrun your fret_num buffer.  \n  * NoteToNum just returns C, one octave above whatever is requested, if you give it an invalid note code.  It really should return some kind of error code so that whatever called it can know that it couldn't recognize the note.  \n* Speaking of which, Note2Num and Num2Note both declare the same static char*[].  That's inefficient and error-prone.  (Especially in this case, since you're then doing a strcmp on them to see if they match.)  Ideally, note2num should just call num2note and compare the input to THAT, rather than reimplementing the same conversion.  \n\nOverall, it's not terrible - you clearly know how to program, how to break down a problem into parts, and express them in code.  But if I were rating it in terms of professional code, I'd say your two biggest problems are that you really need to break out more things into discrete, single-purpose functions, (rather than a giant blog of a main function that does everything) and that you need to guard more things against breaking from invalid inputs.\n\nHope this helps!", "author": "Bwob", "score": 2}
{"id": "deknjbr", "body": "Stop thinking in terms of 'computer science' - start thinking in terms of 'software engineering' - you should find loads of parallels between your current discipline and your new one.\n \nSoftware is built up of components. At the moment, you are building your software out of a single component - it is the civil engineering equivalent of a die cast bridge. It will take a lot of time to get it perfect, but you should start thinking about how you might separate out different components from your giant piece. The best way to do that by far is to see when you repeat yourself (the fundamental rule of software engineering is DRY: don't repeat yourself).\n \nFor that, you need to understand parameters. I can see you understand the USE of them, but you should get in the habit of seeing your own code in terms of the pseudo-algebraic pieces that make it up. That can help you see what might look like different code is actually the same code acting on a different parameter. Here is something you might recognise:\n \n    int doExitFailure (char* message, char* filename) {\n        printf(message, filename);\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\n    }\n \nOnce you have eliminated repeats, the next step in the process (which overall is known as refactoring) is to look at turning a big unwieldy block of crap into a tree. This tree is a visualisation of your code in which each leaf is a small piece which then adds up into a whole. Different people will have different opinions as to how small is small enough - 100% of people agree a single giant trunk is not small enough :-) A good place to look is anywhere you have control flow blocks. If statements or while loops can generally be plucked out into their own functions, which are then called in sequence. Calling sequences of functions as part of sequences as part of sequences and so on is how you make your tree.\n \nThe biggest reason to do this is for later opportunities. If you find yourself needing to do something (let's say read a file) in a new project, you may well remember having a leaf (or function) from this program that read a file. A little tweaking later, and you have a general purpose function for reading a file - now, you never need to write that code again, you can just pull in your function.\n \nThe second biggest reason is change and maintenance. Imagine your current code which reads a file now needs to get a resource from the internet. With everything in one open borders function, making that change can break EVERYTHING. If you instead have it walled off in a function, all it can break is itself, which makes development and testing much easier. Also imagine if you have a bug - right now it could be anywhere. If you have walled off components, you can inspect data before and after to progressively home in on the problem.\n \nAll in all, it seems to work, which is good.

The things that are usually thrown to the wind are: commenting, readability, and maintainability. These are the three things that tend to evolve at a professional level, when you or someone else may need to touch your code five years from now.\n\nI chose to reply to this comment to point out one thing. While it is true that high-level languages do a lot for your, i think it's important to know how that memory management works under the hood. Some may think that it'll all just be optimized away, but that's not really the case. One common example is the O(n^2) complexity associated with concatenating string is Python for example. Your code actually suffers from this a bit with your choice of using realloc, rather than obtaining a length. Practically this is a non-issue, but for very large tabs you will start to see a performance hit. Additionally, requiring a contiguous chunk of memory may artificially limit the length in a fragmented heap (only a problem if you were doing a bunch of other work on the heap). \n\nI would also like to say that while the JavaScript version of tab.js shows a high level of technical proficiency, it does not hit any of the points I require in my shop. The structure of the code is complex, which makes it harder to read when considering your team will also consist of Junior devs. Being that it is small it's not a huge issue, but another problem with the layout is that it makes it hard to add and remove features without potentially considering a total rewrite. Lastly, there are no comments describing in any example providing a TLDR for functions, or explaining why anything is happening. You must read the entire codebase to figure out the purpose of the program. In dgcoffman's defense, I don't believe it was written as an example of how to code in a professional environment (I could be wrong).\n\nOn to your code. Keep in mind here that any feedback is totally subjective and this tends to relate to coding style. A good practice is to seek out well written code-bases, read styling guides, and settle on a style that works for you. Don't get too attached though, because you will likely be required to change some part of it when you change shops. Your creativity should be expressed in how the solution is derived, not how it is written. Though if there is a simpler alternative you should tend to gravitate towards that.\n\n* You should initialize your variables when they are declared. Also, you should try to do your object destruction at the end of your function (goto EXIT is the C equivalent of try/except). This ensures that regardless of how the code in the middle is restructured, your variables will always be initialized, and your objects will always be destroyed. An if check can be used when this means closing a file etc.\n* Always check your return values. Your realloc call can fail. This could result in a null pointer dereference.\n* Never trust the input.\n* Break your main down into functions, and name them, so that it reads like a story. This makes it very clear what the code is doing, and reduces the need for a lot of comments.\n* Comment your code, but when you do focus on the what and why, not the how. The implementation itself describes the how, but it doesn't provide any context that may be useful or important.\n* Simplify, but don't over simplify. A lot of your code is really broken up by the simplicity of the if statements etc. A lot of short lines can make the code harder to read.\n* Organize your processes, so that they are in clean blocks and easy to digest blocks.\n\nWell, it turns out I could write forever on this topic, but I need to get to work. I hope this is useful. I'd be happy to answer any questions, clarify, or provide example if any descriptions are unclear. Overall though, your code is pretty good. I think a few strategy talk and a coding standard and you're off to the races.\n\nPS: High level languages are nice, but it's good to focus on your low-level skills as well. It gives you a lot more understanding of those languages, and the syntaxes tend to be very similar.", "author": "lolis5", "score": 26}

But otherwise, you can just say \"yup, north america, sounds good\" and move on to find out the information you're more likely to look for.\n\nTo put it another way, which of these two functions do you think would be easier for someone else to read and understand?\n\n    void DisplayPicture(string filename) {\n      FileBuffer buffer = LoadFile(filename);\n      Texture texture = GenerateTextureFromBuffer(buffer);\n      DisplayTexture(texture, vec2(0, 0), vec2(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT));\n    }\n\n.... or ....\n\n    void DisplayPicture(string filename) {\n      [50+ lines of file loading and error checking]\n      [1000+ lines of decoding a PNG image and turning it into a texture]\n      [50+ lines of opengl bindings and what not, displaying a texture.]\n    }\n\n\nThe first one, you can tell at a glance what the general shape of the function is going to be, and how it goes about that.  The second one would be a mess, even with good comments.\n\n>When you step into a function you lose access to view the values of all the variables in the parent function that can give context as to what is going on\n\nYou still have access to any values that the function is actually going to act on.  (i. e. any globals, statics, and things passed in via argument.)  This is actually a feature - it narrows down the variable view to *only the variables that matter for the code you're debugging.*\n\nOr, to put it another way, if you care about variables that you CAN'T see from inside the function, then you already know your problem isn't inside the function, and you can safely step out and look somewhere else.\n\n>I don't care about the compiler, I'm talking about humans ability to comprehend something. Obviously I don't think you should write your program in one line with single letter variable names but anything that has no benefits but makes more stuff you need to type and comprehend should be cut.\n\nSee, I would argue that functions actually increase human ability to comprehend complex tasks.  Even though the code might be doing a very complex thing, you don't necessarily need to know all of that at once.  (And in the case of large projects, it might not be practical to hold all of that in your head at once anyway.)\n\nAnd it actually becomes EASIER to debug, because the parts are broken out, and easier to test in isolation.  If I run the function above, and it displays a garbled texture, then I want to figure out what's going wrong.  Am I displaying it wrong?  Am I decoding the file incorrectly?  Heck, is the file even loading correctly?  Since I have those pieces already broken out into functions, I can easily test them individually.  It's trivial to hook up my LoadFile function to some tests, and verify that its output matches what I expect.  It's trivial to send a known buffer into GenerateTextureFromBuffer and see if it gives me an expected output.  It's trivial to send a known, generated texture into DisplayTexture and verify that it can display textures correctly.\n\nAnd this brings us to the other big win that functions get is:  Even if the function isn't reused NOW, having a self-contained logic block that does a descrete task means that in the future, if we say \"dang, I really need to generate a texture over here, too\", I've already done the work of doing so. And because I put them in a function in the first place, it means I don't have to worry about detangling them from local logic.\n\nI mean, the world is big, and there are room for lots of opinions, and write code however makes you happiest.  But definitely be aware, in pretty much any professional setting where code quality and maintainability is important, there are a lot of very good reasons to break out your logic into functions, and very few good reasons not to.", "author": "Bwob", "score": 3}

For example, if people start using goto statements instead of functions (it happens), or if people start adding them in random parts of their code to skip operations when an if statement would be better suited.\n\nLike most things there are two primary cases where I have found goto to be a good option. The first is a replacement to try-except-finally where the concept does not exist, and the other is when you would need a named loop (a nested loop, where break is not sufficient, and break <loopname> is not an option).\n\nIt is actually a common practice, here's an example of how you'd approach a try-finally type scenario: \n[https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/blob/master/Samples/Win7Samples/web/WWSAPI/MessageEncoding/MessageEncoding.cpp](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/blob/master/Samples/Win7Samples/web/WWSAPI/MessageEncoding/MessageEncoding.cpp)\n\nYou would use it in main and all subsequent functions because, unlike exceptions, it wont be raised to the caller.

I imagine it's a whole lot simpler now.\n\n\nAnd I make no apologies for how bad my work was back then. Mostly, I'm just putting it here so people will pick holes in it. Obviously I formatted it a little better than this.\n\n\n**Error correction**\n\nError back propagation relies on the ability to detect the degree of error in the output.  Let us consider the network is undergoing supervised learning i.e. where the desired output is known.  \n\nThe error function is proportional to the output subtracted from the activation, squared.  In Neural computing an introduction (R Beale and T Jackson) this simple concept is converted into a simple formula by differentiating with the aid of the chain rule (pages 70 and 71).  The mathematics is a little much to be included in this simple report, but it is interesting how much it simplifies.\n\n**Delta Value for Output layer**\n\nδpj = k Opj (1 - Opj)(Tpj - Opj)\n\n\n(Neural computing an introduction (R Beale and T Jackson) page 74\n\nGoing back to where we were, we had a value for the output of the node and the value we wish the network to output when presented with this input.  The output value is subtracted from the target value.  This gives an idea of the direction and magnitude that the weight must be corrected by.  This value then undergoes a series of scaling.\n\nFirst it is multiplied by k, which is simply a constant used to control the learning of the network.  \n\nThen it is multiplied by the output of the node minus the output of the node squared (or more simply output * (1 - output)).  This scaling speeds the convergence in the area of the sigmoid curve where the gradient is steep and slows it close to the extremes.\n\nThis produces the delta value for that particular node, this needs to be stored in the memory for later use.\n\n**Delta Value for Hidden layers**\n\nThen it is required to calculate the delta values for the other nodes in the network.  Again after a series of mathematical operations this reduces to a simple form.  \n\n\nδpj = k OPj (1 - OPj)Σ(δpk Wjk)\n\n\n(Neural computing an introduction (R Beale and T Jackson) page 74\n\nThe delta values for the nodes in the hidden layers are simply the sum of the delta values in the layer above, each scaled by their weighted connection.  This value is then scaled as above, ( K * output * ( 1 - output ) ).\n\n**Weight correction**\n\nAfter computing the delta values for all the output nodes and hidden nodes we can proceed with the weight corrections.  This follows the simple formula:\n\nWij(t+1) = Wij(t) + ŋ δpj Opj\n\n\n(Neural computing an introduction (R Beale and T Jackson) page 74)\n\n\nie. the new weight is the old weight plus the correction.  The correction is equal to the delta value of the node the connection points to multiplied by the activation of the source node, then further scaled by the learning factor.  The reason for scaling by the activation is to make correction faster for a connection that is set to on as opposed to off.\n\n**Other factors**\n\nFurther additions may be made to the algorithm to speed up learning and prevent errors in the network.\n\nErrors can form when weights are lost (they are set to 0) or the network gets trapped in a local minimum.\n\nOne method of preventing this is by adding a small amount of noise to the network.  This noise is simply a random factor multiplied by the activation of the connection.  This results in pushing the network out of local minima and encourages learning.\n\nAnother method of speeding up learning is with the addition of a momentum term.  This keeps track of how the weight is changed and if it continues to be corrected in the same direction, the magnitude of the change is increased.", "author": "Bottled_Void", "score": 6}

That is by far the most expensive part of getting data from a row.  When you're comparing accessing a row vs. reading data directly from an index it doesn't matter whether you're getting data from a single column or the whole row because the time it takes to read one column vs. all of them is dwarfed by the time it takes to find the row and read it from disk.\n\n> and if you’re accessing multiple rows you’re not accessing “a row”\n\nThink of accessing multiple rows by PK as accessing a single row by PK and doing that multiple times.  The distinction here is that if you're looking up rows by random PKs (e.g. serially generated IDs) then each read could be anywhere on disk.  And again, finding the row on disk and reading it in is the expensive part.  If you're accessing random rows then it's even worse because the DB can't even read a chunk of rows from disk and cache the page.\n\nThe contrast here is vs. a range query.  Let's say that instead of random PKs you query by a date range.  Even if the PKs are indexed, the fact that you're accessing them randomly will be slower than if you query for a date range over the index.  By doing a range query the DB can find the rows much more efficiently (although if the data is not stored on disk by that date range then you still have the random IO/caching problem).\n\nDatabases are one of the most nuanced things you'll ever work with.  It's very, very rare for there to be a single absolute correct answer because, more than maybe anything else, databases are about making tradeoffs.  You want fast queries? Then prepare for slower writes.  You want indexes on everything?  Then prepare for slower \"best case\" reads because your indexes won't fit in memory.

When I first started using C++ I picked up a lot of patterns from other people's code as I tried to learn and use the language. As I gained experience over the years, I found a good deal of the scaffolding I was writing \"just because that's how it's done\" was superfluous and detrimental. I learned that writing the simplest code possible to solve the problem was the big trick, and that unnecessary complexity was the ultimate enemy.\n\nThis is one lesson I see a lot of programmers failing to learn, though. Too many people seem to think \"I'll throw more design patterns and classes and frameworks into it until it looks done\" without understanding that sprinkled in there, somewhere, are the lines of code that actually do the logic and push the HTTP out of the TCP socket, and you want to chisel them out, not cover them with planks and rubble.\n\n[Case in point](https://medium.com/@webseanhickey/the-evolution-of-a-software-engineer-db854689243#.cpbt1bbf3).", "author": "RowYourUpboat", "score": 12}

{"id": "fylcr37", "body": "I probably can't - it's all proprietary and I'd have to ask permission. They wouldn't let me unless it were for some official site where it could be part of a marketing pitch, like \"<Our Company> Tech Blog\" (we don't have one - at least not yet).\n\nHowever, that being said, I can just discuss here with you a little. The real trick is to critically analyze what's going and determine the true root cause of the issue.\n\nThe main problem my clients have WRT REST is just basic networking. Sure, your container orchestrator may have a concept for forwarding requests on a certain port to a container within, but in a larger system and in one with dynamic scaling or provisioning, you won't know which node is running a given service. Or you may need to load balance. So, people use these dynamic routers where when services boot they register their presence, and then clients of the service ask the router for the location (option 1) or, the router forwards like a reverse proxy to the service (option 2). The worst case is when people don't use something like Envoy and instead write their own registry & lookup system, so that making a request takes 2 or more requests.\n\nWith a messaging system, you have similar options. You can use a pattern like probe-match to find specific instances, which would be like option 1 above, or you can use a work queue or topic so that it's all transparently handled.\n\nSometimes ServiceA -> B -> C chains are not the problem of a router service, but an unfortunate matter of data handling principles. I try to teach my clients to disambiguate between *authoritative* data vs. *duplicate* data. Sometimes in the zeal to uphold the single authoritative source principal, we end up instilling zero duplication principles and creating these long service chains. The net result is that you have a \"distributed monolith.\" Ideally, try to think about data content vs. data shape. \n\nLet's say I am Wikipedia and I have a page service that tracks the history of wiki pages in terms of their content, users, and the deltas over time. Now I've added a search feature and it's going to be another service. It makes sense to come up with a bulk copy from the page service to the search service. Search *needs* that data, but it doesn't need it to be in the same shape as the page service. We don't want search to query the page service in order to function. Search needs to maintain a natural language index over the most current pages. And it needs to re-index whenever a page is updated. So in terms of what it stores locally as its own authoritative data, it will *not* be the page data. But it would be inefficient for the search service to scrape all the page data as REST queries from the page service, especially on-demand.\n\nIt sounds like this duplication problem may be more the case here - Service C owns a dataset that Service B needs to use, and Service B is perhaps your JWT generator/validator and so Service A (and the others) all need to call it. In that case, I would think about data ownership and responsibility and not necessarily messaging pattern. The best answer might be to arrange out-of-band bulk transfer from service C to B. However, service B needs to remember that it is not the authoritative source of these data and it should effectively treat it as a cache. Service C could send invalidation events, such that B knows to fetch from C based on other happenings. To this end, a broker could help you.\n\nSo let's say you configure a messaging broker in your system and configure a static virtual IP for this broker, so you can set its address as part of your container's environment in keeping with 12factor.net.\n\n1. Possibly schedule a bulk transfer from C -> B at some interval. The necessary interval will depend on your business case and not so much technical ones.\n2. Consider this data a cache, and what policies for invalidation may apply. Time? LRU? Memory pressure? You can use broadcast events from C for B to eagerly clear cache for items that are updated outside the bulk transfer schedule. On cache miss, query C.\n\nOf course, you can use messaging to talk A -> B or B -> C if it makes sense.\n\nSome messaging patterns lend themselves well to distributed applications:\n\n* Broadcasts, for the case when you're running multiple service Bs and they all need to invalidate a part of their cache.\n* Probe-Match, a messaging pattern where you broadcast a query, all listeners that can handle it respond with a queue name, and then the actual request is sent directly to the queue in the first response you receive. It's used for dynamic load distribution.\n* Work queues, most brokers support round-robin work queues. It's better than round-robin forwarding on the network, as when you add an n^(th) node, each of the *n-1* nodes before are still forwarded requests in order as part of the pool. However in a balanced work queue, a less-loaded node could take more work than a more-loaded node, assuming that the previous nodes are struggling. Good since you usually spin up extra compute on demand when requests are heavy.\n\nI think that's it for now; hopefully that gives you some ideas about how to approach your problem.", "author": "aoeudhtns", "score": 15}

That works if you truly never have to open the black box, which is the case with a third-party dependency.  But all too often, when the abstraction is within your own codebase, the abstraction is either leaky or is never quite complete (i.e. the feature requests require you to continue to modify the abstraction).  In that case, the developers end up with the burden of understanding both sides of the abstraction, which can result in an overall net increase of burden.  (My most recent personal example was an abstraction which had been created around a video player in an iOS app -- over the course of the ~18 months it was in the codebase, it ended up just creating more work).  Something to think about.\n\nEdit: I should temper the tempering by saying that the video player abstraction suffered from a classic sin: the abstraction was created when N was still 1.  That is, it was a preemptive abstraction, rather than an abstraction created after-the-fact as a refactor.  This is almost always doomed to failure, because you cannot anticipate what the surface area of the abstraction will ultimately need to be when you only have one instance to base the abstraction on.  (In the video player example, when we did end up swapping out the video player, the new player's interface was completely different, so the abstraction had to be completely redesigned, which ended up creating more total work than if we had never abstracted it in the first place).\n\nIn your case, the cookware selection is created after N reached 3, so you are in a much better position to design an abstraction which is a net benefit.", "author": "kbder", "score": 4}

If it didn't, you wouldn't need A/B testing...) With regular old A/B testing, you can give the experimental behavior to 1% or even 0.1% of your users and by doing so you limit the potential damage.\n\nFor that matter, you might suspect ahead of time that your experimental \"improvement\" is actually not that likely to be better and may very well be worse. Maybe it's something risky or controversial idea but for some reason you feel it's worth trying just in case you're wrong. (For example, maybe someone in the office thinks an ugly pink and brown button is better than the more normal colors.)\n\nAlso, sometimes you can't even use this method. Basically, this method relies on getting *fast feedback*. Since you aren't building into the system any initial educated guesses about which experience to give the user, it needs to learn quickly. This isn't always possible for technical reasons. Maybe you record stats into an offline log and gather / aggregate / analyze them in a daily batch job. Sometimes it's not possible for nontechnical reasons. Perhaps you are changing the UI of the final checkout process, and you are trying to track whether this causes an increase in the percentage of carts that are abandoned 24 hours later.\n\nFinally, this system is stateful and requires updates of a centralized table on every operation. If you have a really large scale site (millions of users, hundreds of servers, etc.), that could be a bottleneck. It's definitely possible to shard or parallelize it, but that's a pain.

{"id": "h101e24", "body": "I tend to disagree with the beliefs the other coders in this comment section seem to have about this drama; neither Repl.it nor his open source project are meaningfully unique. Someone could release a better application tomorrow with existing technology. Someone’s probably working on one right now. Sorry, but its just not a trade secret, and the market is saturated with platforms like this.\n\nNon-compete agreements are not defensible in Californian courts, so unless they patented whatever was in there they have no leg to stand on.\nThe real issue though is how the CEO handled this. It’s perfectly OK for someone to express concerns that code exposed by an old employee may actually be dangerously similar to your own, and he’s correct that once you’ve seen a certain decent solution, it seems obvious in hindsight. But there’s no real argument to be made that someone who leaves Facebook, disillusioned with either company or product, is not allowed to make a better social media, pulling from *unpatented* techniques and patterns learned during their employment. This is a ridiculous concept – the opposite of this is how many American products are created, intellectually or materially, regardless of how you feel about any grey area here. \n\nBut he doesn’t express those concerns rationally or work with him to remove the offending code; he’s jumping straight to legal action. He basically says, we’ve raised 20M and are going to use it to crush you. Then he attacks his character: “the most demanding intern we’ve ever had”, despite having offered him a job just a few emails ago. He makes no effort to discuss the event afterwards with this intern, despite Radon’s response, his desire to discuss and understand further (what just happened?) and his acquiescing to Amjad’s demands. Amjad is supposedly a leader in his field and the boss of many employees, yet fails to show any leadership qualities in a monumental fashion. It just doesn’t look good. Amjad is using his position of power manipulatively and acting tyrannically, and basically asked for this exposition to be posted by suggesting that “anyone else would think the same”.\n\nLastly, the section of Repl.it that this open source project touches is a very small subset of its total features. I am happy for Radon that he was able to rehost it after this post got attention. It sounds like he was, and I hope continues to be, a very active open source community contributor, and this project **poses no real threat to Repl.it**. \n\nThis guy Amjad be trippin.", "author": "ShuckForJustice", "score": 29}

They require discussion of what they are potential indicators of.\n\nA good example is that a lot of automated tools will detect use of random numbers as a security code smell because it's an indication that someone might be rolling their own cryptography.

Well, mostly.\n\nPartly because of dvorak, I missed some of the best parts of vi (hjkl). I can use vim, but I'm not a wizard, I'm just good enough that I can comfortably prefer it to nano.\n\nBut all kinds of speed have a direct impact on capability. For example:\n\n* Git is obscenely fast, especially at branching and merging, and is *much* more accurate at merging than SVN. Once you hit a certain speed/reliability threshold, you might create local branches just for fun.\n* My browser being instantaneous, predictive, and always-on means that whenever I wonder something, I simply look up the answer. There are tons of these, from proper research for an argument to simple idle curiosity, which I would just shrug and ignore were I still on dialup, or on a machine that requires *seconds* to open a tab.\n* Modern hardware is now fast enough that \"scripting\" languages are actually being taken seriously -- Ruby on Rails was a thing, and now Clojure is a thing. In turn, the speed of using an interactive shell to explore an API contributes immensely to learning -- even when I'm writing pure Java, I keep JRuby around just for that, it's Java's missing REPL.\n* I currently run automated tests only rarely, and that's on *production* code. Yes, I make sure everything passes before deploy. Tools like autotest make sense here, but the tests take half an hour to run. If I could massively-parallelize them and, say, borrow a bunch of machines to run them on -- if they ran in maybe 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes -- that's not quite enough to run them on every commit, but maybe enough to run them on every push. This is what SauceLabs can do, in theory. (Haven't been able to try them out -- this is a part-time job for a very corporate place, and I guess they're balking at the price?)\n\nI could go on. And on. Point is, *performance matters.*\n\nSo, in the case of text: It's not just that I can ramble on this long, and not have the keyboard really be a noticeable bottleneck. (I just got my first smartphone, and *that* is noticeable, I now know how everyone over the age of 60 must feel when forced to use a modern PC.) It's more that the conceptual barrier to proper commenting, variable names that don't suck, and so on is much lower.\n\nI mean, hopefully pair programming leads to you being appropriately ridiculed when someone does\n\n    x = 5\n\nrather than *at least* something like\n\n    num_frogs = 5\n\nBut I think there's still a difference between having this as a barrier, to where you'll choose a different name to save a few keystrokes, and just typing what makes the most sense.\n\nNote, though: It is for exactly this reason that I despise Java and C++. There is an *insane* amount of verbosity needed to get anything done. It's getting better, but still. C++ especially -- things like the Rule of Four, C-style headers, and so on, make me reluctant to create a new class when I don't have to.

It pains me to even *think* about using something other than Git for VCS, and I write in both Clojure and Ruby (my current paid project is RoR), and I share your distaste of the verbosity of certain statically typed languages.\n\nSpeed does matter - but the perceived downside/slowness/learning-curve/whatever of pairing is usually vastly overestimated, in my opinion.  If you can write code, you can write code.  You can read code.  You can probably use numerous editors.  You can probably talk about what you're doing.  And you know when to take it easy and give your mind a rest.  \n\nAlso, and this is not a criticism, but automated tests shouldn't take so long to run!  It's actually quite difficult to write good automated tests, especially in an environment like Rails / etc.  But automated testing is, at least to me, absolutely essential.  The extra say, 5 hours you'd spend learning the irritating, frustrating, idiotic details of how to isolate your tests pays itself back to you in like 2 weeks tops.  I'm working in a Rails app of ~1.2MLOC, and our entire automated test suite takes about 15mins to run, and that is *terribly long*!  The workflow I consider normal is to write until something is done, commit, write until something is done, commit, etc... when the feature/card/whatever is done, run the entire test suite, then push.  There isn't any reason a test suite, at least for 1.2MLOC of RoR, should take more than maybe 2 minutes.  And even that's painful!\n\nAll digressions aside however, pairing does lead to something like a 15% productivity increase iirc - it is actually quite efficient.  \n\nAll of this I say fully understanding that: if the people you pair with suck, pairing sucks, and is hugely counterproductive.  But if you work with overall fairly decent people, it's really not so bad.  You might not know the editor, but they might not know yours.  Sharing knowledge rarely hurts, at least in my experience.\n\nedit: and yes, variable naming, method naming, class naming, class structure, etc all improve (in my experience) with pairing, although I never argue over them.  I am the type of person who, for the most part, uses one-letter iterative variables in my own code.  But when someone else has to read it, or maybe 5 or 10 or 20 other people have to read it, the benefit your development team gets from a 30 second conversation of \"hey, why not call this customer_group instead of cg?\" is definitely worth it.  YMMV, and I'm not meaning to be a dogmatist - there are loads of things about \"agile\" that I dislike - but pairing is one thing I've found to be really positive for my teams, my projects and myself.

I am at least partly to blame, however, as I haven't *added* many tests since I joined -- I joined in more-or-less panic mode (all previous developers had left), and it was all I could do to get the existing tests running again, so I could be reasonably sure I wasn't introducing regressions.\n\nI have *maintained* the tests, at least.\n\nI mean, for example, we could probably shave off a good 5-10 minutes by excluding all third-party services from tests. (In our Selenium tests, we're still even loading ads.) We could kill another 30-50% of the remaining time by upgrading to Ruby 1.9. The project is in maintenance mode, and I'm not full-time, so it *could* happen, but not yet.\n\nThen divide by four by running it in parallel on the Macbook.\n\n> The extra say, 5 hours you'd spend learning the irritating, frustrating, idiotic details of how to isolate your tests pays itself back to you in like 2 weeks tops.\n\nRight, now multiply by 4 (I'm part-time), then divide by the \"OMG WE NEED FEATURE X NOW\" demand. And I am the *only* Ruby developer at this company, that I know of.\n\nIf I truly had free reign and time, I could say \"Alright, feature freeze. *Nothing* new is happening for a few months while I clean this up, and port it to Rails3 and either Ruby19 or JRuby.\n\n> I'm working in a Rails app of ~1.2MLOC...\n\nI'll have to get back to you on that. It's big, but I haven't really calculated it before. Gotta love Rails organization, though -- I rarely get *lost* in there.\n\n> All of this I say fully understanding that: if the people you pair with suck, pairing sucks, and is hugely counterproductive. But if you work with overall fairly decent people, it's really not so bad. You might not know the editor, but they might not know yours. Sharing knowledge rarely hurts, at least in my experience.\n\nIt's not as much a matter of knowing, but of preference. For example, if I had to use a largely GUI-driven editor, particularly one which didn't have a quick keyboard way of navigating *between* files, I imagine that'd eat through the 15% performance gain pretty quickly.\n\nSo I'm not dismissing it altogether, I'm just trying to see how to retain my own personal best performance (and best overall job satisfaction) by retaining control over my dev environment.\n\n> I am the type of person who, for the most part, uses one-letter iterative variables in my own code.

I'll use one-letter variables, but only in *short* one-liners.\n\n> I'd love to pair on some of my personal stuff, even if it was remotely via tmux!\n\nI'll have to get back to you on that. I'm doing both work (real work -- the Rails site I maintain, by myself, gets thousands of unique visitors per day) and school (this is group project semester, so *tons* of coding for that).

These improvements may be invisible depending on your success metrics.\n- To software engineers: You should also have an understanding of architectures if you are going to be the one making that choice. You need to be aware of the infrastructural requirements for effective microservice architecture.\n\nI didn't care for the article, personally. The author has a grasp of what is necessary for microservices to be effective, but seems to be blaming microservices for organizational shortcomings. Kubernetes breaking is only a existential crisis, for example, if you aren't willing to invest in dev ops. **The article should have been \"this is what will prepare you for building microservices\"** and not a diatribe about the microservice trend.\n\nThis is his list of things you need for microservices - \n\n- A Kubernetes cluster\n- A load balancer\n- Multiple compute instances for running the app and hosting the K8S cluster\n- One or more (relational) databases, depending on whether you’re gonna go with single database per service or not\n- A messaging system for service-service communication, e.g. Kafka\n- Jenkins for CI(CD)\n- Kibana for log aggregation\n- Prometheus for monitoring\n- Jaeger/Zipkin for distributed tracing\n\nI mean, welcome to the modern world, hombre.

He described an architecture for an electronic digital computer with parts consisting of a processing unit containing an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and processor registers, a control unit containing an instruction register and program counter (PC), a memory to store both data and instructions, external mass storage, and input and output mechanisms. The meaning has evolved to be any stored-program computer in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time because they share a common bus.\"`\n\nSo this guy has rewritten how computer hardware components talk to each other?

Probably, but probably not. \n\nThe reason for this is that when looping the compiler/hardware will assume that you're going to loop back, since that's the more common case, and will optimize for that. Since it's the same set of instructions repeated over and over again it's very fast (as it doesn't have to go an fetch additional instructions) and the compiler can do additional tricks like unrolling the loop. With a standalone if/else statement the system will have to pick to prefer a branch hit or miss and the instructions could incur an instruction cache hit or miss. \n\nIn other words one way or another the \"good\" code is as efficient or more efficient than the \"bad\" code.\n\n> Either way, the performance difference will be insignificant in most applications \n\nOh, most likely, but we can't know that without data.

On the 386, SX meant that the data bus from the CPU was 16-bit even though the processor was a 32-bit processor (meaning the pointer length was 32-bit). What this meant was that to fetch any 32-bit value from memory (such as a data pointer) it would require 2 clock cycles to retrieve. What was worse was when you fetched a 32-bit value from an address which wasn't word aligned as you would fetch the first part of the value as a 32-bit chunk from memory taking two clock cycles, then fetch the second part of the value as a second 32-bit chunk from memory requiring 2 more clock cycles. If you had badly aligned data, it could take 4 clock cycles just to read a value into a register. The 386 DX had a 32-bit data bus to match the processors word length so would usually take 1 clock cycle, and maybe 2 if the your word alignment was off. This sounds horrendous until you realize that any data not in the CPU cache would take multiple clock cycles to retrieve from RAM anyway, so adding an extra clock cycle here and there didn't hurt things too much.\n\nWith the 486, the SX/DX designation specified if you had an FPU (Floating Point Unit). If you didn't, any floating point math had to be done in software using integers (and was actually the norm before the 486DX). The 486SX motherboard would often have a math coprocessor socket to allow you to add an FPU. This was a bit of a mislead, as it was actually another CPU socket, and the FPU would just be a full 486DX. It would bypass the 486SX processor and just use the DX one completely.\n\nMany 386SX and DX motherboards also had math coprocessor sockets, but this was adding an FPU to the 386, and did nothing to change the SX/DX nature. To do that, you would need to route a whole new set of bus wires from the processor around the motherboard to the various components and isn't something you could even do, never mind with a simple chip upgrade.", "author": "mattimus_maximus", "score": 4}

And typically, programming languages ship with excellent general-use algorithms that aren't tailored, but are good enough 99% of the time.\n\nUnless you are operating on some incredible scale (and sometimes even if you are), you should be starting with the most straightforward code you can, and *only* compromise that obviousness in favor of correctness and performance *as problems arise.* Anything else is premature optimization.\n\nSometimes it's justified to do something atypical for speed. You will not know when that's justified, until you build and profile your prototype - it's almost guaranteed you will misjudge, even. This is why benchmarking and hard evidence matter. And in the rare case where you need to optimize, the correct algorithm is probably another drop-in interchangeable black box, with well-described performance dynamics, which you can study when you need to.\n\nTo be clear, algorithms and data structures are a personally fascinating pursuit. You can improve your brain by learning them.

You cannot build a tuple with a comprehension, the parenthesised comprehension syntax creates an iterator. You need to explicitly use a tuple constructor to get a tuple:\n\n    >>> (x for x in \"\")\n    <generator object <genexpr> at 0x...>\n    >>> tuple(x for x in \"\")\n    ()\n\nPlease also take a look at the builtin `typing` module, as its design fully supports my argument. A `List` is designed as a container for homogenous elements, hence you'd write `List[int]` to describe the type of `[1, 2, 3]`. By contrast, doing `Tuple[int]` means a tuple with a single element of type int, e.g. `(1,)`. To have three elements, you'd do `Tuple[int, int, int]`.\n\nConsider also this: if you'd want a list with mixed strings and ints, you'd have to do a `List[Union[str, int]]`, and prove to the type checker, that you've checked the concrete element type at runtime. Not so with tuples, a `Tuple[str, int, str]` will always have exactly three elements with exactly the given types. You'd do:\n\n    my_parrot = \"Poly\", 42, \"dead\"\n\nNotice the semantic and structural similarity to this:\n\n    from dataclasses import dataclass, field\n    @dataclass\n    class Parrot:\n        name: str = field()\n        age: int = field()\n        status: str = field()\n\nNow again, both lists and tuples support iteration, destructuring, using + for concatenation... But likewise, you can take `__dict__` from an arbitrary object and argue that objects are iterable containers.\n\n> The semantics of a tuple are, to most people, much more similar to a list than a struct. It's much simpler and more intuitive to say \"tuples are immutable lists\" than \"tuples are kind of like an anonymous, immutable struct with indexed fields\".\n\nIt's simpler, but you completely miss all of the nuances.

(You can cast everything to a Top type, like Any or Object, but then you lose the ability to extract those things and differentiate them later without dynamic checks.)\n\nBut Python is *not* a statically typed language and its lists, free of use for type checking, are not specifically meant to be homogeneous. Actually, the literature tends to favor a distinction of terms here: *lists* are heterogeneous sequences where *arrays* are homogenous. (This isn't 100%, of course, but the trend is noticeable.)\n\nScheme is a language with a long-running tradition of using heterogeneous lists for many purposes, so this is not unique to Python.\n\nIf you want the guarantees afforded by a static type system... use a statically typed language. :) In a discussion of a dynamic world, I think it is wrong to impose the views of static types.\n\n>\tIt's simpler, but you completely miss all of the nuances.

And beginners are the people you would need to explain tuples to. I think the simple intuition is far more useful here.\n\nI also don't think it's likely that someone would get to a point of \"needing to develop a deeper understanding of the language\" and not be able to rectify their initial impression of tuples. Further, I don't think that at such a time it is likely somebody would say to themselves \"Oh, tuples aren't *immutable lists*, they're *immutable anonymous structs with indexed fields*!\" Rather, I imagine they would develop an intuition for tuples as primitive types separate from lists and structs entirely.", "author": "DonaldPShimoda", "score": 1}

Allowing the misconception to continue (or going as far as trying to proliferate it) helps exactly nothing, but as soon as you challenge it, it actually opens up questions (or, I guess, downvotes), because *why would both exist*? Can I quote the Zen of Python here? There should be one (and preferably only one) way to do it! They were both here since Python 1.x! There must be a reason!\n\nChallenge a newbie's worldview and their natural curiosity and thirst for knowledge should lead them to learn something - anonymous structs are useful and empowering in a very similar way to anonymous functions, type factories, or decorators. Yes, all of these concepts can be initially dense, but this **is** what leads to a better understanding. Then you go around and find out e.g. Rust has a Result type, but it's not anonymous - many crates define their own error and result types, and when learning to deal with that you suddenly develop another kind of appreciation for the anonymous struct pattern (just as much as you do for ADTs, and surprise surprise, check out PEP 622).\n\n(Also, I love how Python is extremely transparent here, contrast with just how magical are multiple return values in e.g. Lua or Go.)\n\n> [...] heterogeneous lists are known to be problematic for static type checkers.\n\nThey also tend to be equally problematic for any actual code that has to handle them piecewise.\n\n> Scheme is a language with a long-running tradition of using heterogeneous lists for many purposes, so this is not unique to Python.\n\nYes, but a (theoretical, pure) Lisp has basically no other data structures besides a cons pair disguised as a list. So you end up using cons for everything, you literally build the rest of the language (including the actual lists) on top of that. And this is fine, as this is by design, and it's that design that brought Lisp its power and fame. Python, also by design, has distinct, builtin collection types for distinct use cases, and I'd argue it's one of the most well-designed languages to ever reach that kind of scale.", "author": "rollc_at", "score": 1}

Maybe some of them will ultimately go into more formal and shared documentation, but I doubt any of my colleagues is particularly interested in the 47-point hierarchical to-do list I made this morning to plan out the feature I'm going to be implementing over the next couple of days. I, on the other hand, find I work much better if I put together a systematic plan for that sort of thing before I dive in.\n\nThis has nothing to do with job security or bus numbers. It's simply information that isn't particularly useful out of context or to anyone not working on it in the immediate or near future. My log file runs to more than 100,000 lines written over a period of years for one current project. It would be insanely impractical to write up all of the casual notes and memory joggers in there in a form that would make sense to others on the off chance that it would one day be useful, but it's useful to me at the time, and sometimes I remember something we worked on once before or that I had some thoughts about previously, and a quick search finds it for me. And yes, I could fall under a bus, and anything only in my log would be lost to the project, but the information would have been just as lost if I'd never written it down and only kept it in my head. The really important stuff goes into the code and tests and bug trackers and other shared assets that everyone has access to anyway.\n\nI don't agree that keeping the little details written down somewhere is a failure in process, because I don't think any process and tools exist -- or *could* exist -- that would cost-effectively capture all of those little details in a form that was useful to others without my participation. Not everything in every project can be written up formally all the time, and developer experience is a thing, and developers aren't interchangeable.

You may well be right, but I would've said exactly the same thing about web apps before I saw Rails. Just the idea of an automagical ORM is crazy if you're coming from a Java world -- there's all these normalization questions you have to ask, there's all these different and arguably better ways you *could* write a query, but just having a default, even a suboptimal one, saves so much time that it's worth it anyway.\n\n> maybe your unit to be glued is a word and you shard by file then sum together the count at the end, maybe it is a file and you shard by directory then string-concat together the result in the end, etc.\n\nYeah, there are limiting factors there, but I'm talking about things like:\n\n     conf.setOutputKeyClass(Text.class);\n     conf.setOutputValueClass(IntWritable.class);\n\n     conf.setMapperClass(Map.class);\n     conf.setCombinerClass(Reduce.class);\n     conf.setReducerClass(Reduce.class);\n\n     conf.setInputFormat(TextInputFormat.class);\n     conf.setOutputFormat(TextOutputFormat.class);\n\nThat's just *wiring up the classes.* That's not even defining any of the logic -- I mean, there are three lines there just telling it that your map class is called Map and your reduce class is called Reduce. There's even this shit:\n\n    private final static IntWritable one = new IntWritable(1);\n    ...\n      output.collect(word, one);\n\nOkay, this is partly Java's fault, but seriously? Is writing an int such an uncommon thing that you can't have a specialization of `collect` that accepts an int?\n\nMeanwhile, here's a Ruby one-liner:\n\n    puts File.read('/dev/stdin').split.group_by{|x|x}.map{|k,v| [k, v.count].join(' ')}.join(\"\\n\")\n\nI'm cheating a bit with group_by, and of course you wouldn't actually write code like this, and it's not scalable (I'm slurping the whole file)... but on the other hand, I even included all the formatting of the original program.\n\nI admit, this is kind of like the \"taco bell\" solution (just in Ruby), but this is closer to what I expected from MapReduce, especially after playing with CouchDB views and such.

If it works, why change it? \n* The licensing costs \\(including support contracts\\) for big companies with lots of Oracle instances can be much lower than you expect. The price point will be tuned to consider how much it would cost to replace the systems/migrate databases\n* The support was also pretty decent; I remember that we had various NDA's and data sensitivity agreements with Oracle and \\(about 11/12 years ago\\), when we had an issue with the DB we literally shipped the entire db \\(a few hundred gig\\) to them.

And going with a functional approach instead of imperative/OO gives you great potential for sensible visualization of data flow - and ultimately, it's more elegant and should be *easier* for end-users.\n\n> Regarding 1GB (…)\n\nThe size of those dependencies are unfortunate, but I think it's simply not a focus for the project *right now*, so it makes sense.

However, the alternative actually shown is so cumbersome in Java that I might have chosen not to apply the refactoring in that particular case anyway. Here's their original Java:\n\n    String foundPerson(String[] people){\n        for (int i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {\n            if (people[i].equals (\"Don\")){\n                return \"Don\";\n            }\n            if (people[i].equals (\"John\")){\n                return \"John\";\n            }\n            if (people[i].equals (\"Kent\")){\n                return \"Kent\";\n            }\n        }\n        return \"\";\n    }\n\nHere's their refactored Java:\n\n    String foundPerson(String[] people){\n        List candidates = Arrays.asList(new String[] {\"Don\", \"John\", \"Kent\"});\n        for (int i=0; i < people.length; i++)\n            if (candidates.contains(people[i]))\n                return people[i];\n        return \"\";\n    }\n\nAnd now here's the approximate equivalent of that refactored code in a language that is good at this sort of thing like Haskell:\n\n    foundPerson people = find (`elem` [\"Don\", \"John\", \"Kent\"]) people\n\nAnd in Python:\n\n    def foundPerson(people):\n        return next((p for p in people if p in [\"Don\", \"John\", \"Kent\"]), None)\n\n\n\nIn Haskell or Python, you can easily see the common/repeated aspect this way. You might go further and factor out a function for the more general structure, which finds the first matching string from an arbitrary set in a given list. In a statically typed language, maybe you would generalise further still to finding the first matching item (of any type supporting equality) from an arbitrary set in a given list.\n\nIn Java, that common/repetitive aspect isn't at all transparent in the refactored version because there's so much boilerplate. I think most programmers would spend longer figuring out what the refactored version is doing than they would reading the original, so if we really were only looking at three cases I'd be tempted to keep the simple and readable original version.\n\n[Edit: Minor typo fixing and wording tweaks.]", "author": "Silhouette", "score": 1}

That is what this kind of algorithm looks like in a language with a syntax that is reasonably expressive by contemporary standards and, in Haskell's case, with a more powerful and comprehensive standard library when it comes to manipulating data. Unless you count punctuation, there is literally no boilerplate in the Haskell version. The Python one is a little clunky because of the generator comprehension but still a transparent one-liner. In either case, you could fit practically the whole implementation into the space it takes just to write a literal array of strings in useful form in Java.\n\n[Edit: Typo]", "author": "Silhouette", "score": 2}
{"id": "cp5o5np", "body": "i do know what it looks like in good languages - i mainly use ocaml, ruby, clojure and racket for my hobby stuff, and have dabbled a bit in haskell and python :) but let us look at the java code (slightly reformatted, because i do agree their formatting was bad), with comments interspersed:\n\n    String foundPerson(String[] people){\n        // these are the names we are interested in, \n        // as a simple declarative list\n        List candidates = Arrays.asList(new String[] {\n           \"Don\", \"John\", \"Kent\"\n        });\n\n        // iterate through the list of people; standard java idiom.\n        // i agree that `for person in people` would have been better.\n        for (int i=0; i < people.length; i++) {\n            // this is superbly readable:\n            if (candidates.contains(people[i])) {\n                return people[i];\n            }\n        }\n        return \"\";\n    }\n\ntrue, it would be a two-liner in ruby\n\n    def found_person(person)\n        candidates = %w(Don John Kent)\n        people.any? {|person| candidates.include? person}\n    end\n\nbut the java is not significantly worse, and with the addition of range-based for loops and list literals it would have been almost zero-boilerplate code. even without, it is very clear and readable, and the list of candidates has been expressed once-and-only-once up front.\n\nalso, despite having done a fair bit of (2.6 era) python in a previous job and a little python 3 recently, i found your python snippet pretty hard to read. in fact i skimmed through the docs on generator comprehensions, and i still don't understand it fully - i'm guessing that the `return next(...)` is boilerplate that mixes up the internal details of generators with the desire for a short-circuiting `find`. it's more succinct, but not necessarily more clear.", "author": "zem", "score": 1}
{"id": "cp5q1r9", "body": "There is certainly an element of knowing your tools and what you're used to, I agree, but I think it's fair to say that the Haskell and Python examples I gave are both idiomatic in their respective languages.\n\nFor example, in Python, a generator comprehension is essentially a lazy version of a list comprehension, and is written exactly the same way except with `()` rather than `[]` around it. The `next` function is built-in and returns the next value for any iterable thing, optionally taking a value to return instead if the source has run out. So yes, using `next` with a generator comprehension does give you the short-circuiting behaviour.\n\nI suppose my point is that even if that isn't easy for you to read immediately, it soon would be if you were working with modern Python on a regular basis. Likewise if you're used to imperative programming and C-style syntax, that Haskell snippet is probably quite alien, but anyone who used Haskell regularly would instantly recognise the significance of things like the backticks. The language is fine, it's just a question of familiarity with how to use it, as with any tool.\n\nOn the other hand, to fix the Java code, you need to change the language, for example by adding better list literals and using a for-in loop as you mentioned. Personally, I also find the reversal where you have an algorithm to work with `people` but the test is built with `candidates.contains` a little awkward, but it's not the end of the world.\n\nIn the absence of at least those new language features, for a requirement that was only comparing with 2-3 different cases, I still think the clumsy refactored Java shown is far worse for readability than the slightly repetitive but completely transparent code it replaced, though I completely agree that it doesn't scale well and for greater numbers of cases I would rapidly swing the other way. But I'd still think the code looked ugly and was a terrible example of the potential benefits from refactoring. ;-)", "author": "Silhouette", "score": 1}
{"id": "cp5r7p1", "body": "you're missing the fact that if you're working with java on a regular basis, the refactored code is perfectly readable and idiomatic, rather than clumsy (: i think java was chosen because a high number of people interested in learning refactoring work with an algol-syntaxed object-oriented language, so java lets you introduce new ideas in a familiar setting. i would be no more keen on working in java than you are, but i cannot for the life of me see what is not transparent about that code snippet. i find the python code you posted a lot less transparent; i actually have to stop and construct a mental model of a generator to see why `next` is used that way.\n\nthis would be what i would consider transparent python code, on the level of the illustrative refactorings on that site:\n\n    for person in people:\n      if person in candidates:\n        return person\n    return None\n\nusing chained generators in that way is reasonably neat, and might be idiomatic python once you're used to the way generators work, but it distracts from the refactoring itself, which is trying to illustrate \"recognise that you are manually unrolling a 'find in array' loop\"", "author": "zem", "score": 1}
{"id": "cp5vl1g", "body": "As it happens, I *do* work with Java on a regular basis among other languages... I'm not suggesting that the code isn't idiomatic Java (sadly) or that it can't be understood.

In particular, I'm suggesting that it may be sufficiently clumsy that I'm not sure it's actually clearer than the original in this case. Sometimes the overhead of abstracting away a recurring pattern is worse than just having a *small* amount of repetition of the pattern itself.\n\nNow, if the example had originally been written in the analogous unrefactored Python, and had the refactored version followed the style you showed in the parent comment, I would have said it was a good demonstration of refactoring. Your version has the same neater design for abstracting the search loop instead of manually apply all the original manual comparisons one by one, but it's clean, idiomatic Python without excessive boilerplate to camouflage that underlying change.\n\nWhat I find most interesting about our different perspectives here is that despite mentioning before that you've worked with several functional programming languages, and apparently agreeing that abstracting the loop control to a for-in style would be clearer, you seem to strongly dislike the idiom of taking the head of a lazy list when you see it in Python. But a more declarative, functional style is obviously a polarising issue for programmers today, with some people taking to it naturally and some finding it quite counter-intuitive, so perhaps it's not the best example for debating the original point.", "author": "Silhouette", "score": 2}

{"id": "j9f9z5i", "body": "Hi everyone, this is my first open source project so here's a bit more info on how it's used.\n\nTo integrate Pythagora, you need to **paste only one line of code** to your repository and run the Pythagora capture command. Then, just play around with your app and from all API requests and database queries Pythagora will generate integration tests.\n\nWhen an API request is being captured, Pythagora saves all database documents used during the request (before and after each db query). When you run the test, first, Pythagora connects to a temporary `pythagoraDb` database and restores all saved documents. This way, the database state is the same during the test as it was during the capture so the test can run on any environment while NOT changing your local database. Then, Pythagora makes an API request tracking all db queries and checks if the API response and db documents are the same as they were during the capture.\n\n**For example, if the request updates the database after the API returns the response, Pythagora checks the database to see if it was updated correctly.**\n\nFinally, Pythagora tracks (using istanbul/nyc) lines of code that were triggered during tests, so you know how much of your code is covered by captured tests. So far, I tested Pythagora on open source clones of sites (Reddit, IG, etc.), and some personal projects and I was able to get 50% of code coverage within 10 minutes and to 90% within 1 hour of playing around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here’s a demo video of how Pythagora works** \\- [https://youtu.be/Be9ed-JHuQg](https://youtu.be/Be9ed-JHuQg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTbh, I never had enough time to properly write and maintain tests so I’m hoping that with Pythagora, people will be able to cover apps with tests without having to spend too much time writing tests.\n\nCurrently, Pythagora is quite limited and it supports only Node.js apps with Express and Mongoose but if people like it, I'll work on expanding the capabilities.\n\nAnyways, I’m excited to hear what you think.\n\n**How do you write integration tests for your API server? Would you consider using Pythagora instead/along with your system?**\n\n**If not, I'd love to hear what are your concerns and why this wouldn’t work for you?**\n\nAny feedback or ideas are welcome.", "author": "zvone187", "score": 15}

{"id": "ff3kkyc", "body": "Pair programming has been both powerful and ineffective in my experience. If you have two engaged, roughly similarly-skilled engineers working on a nontrivial problem, it was usually very effective at producing better code than one of the developers would on their own.\n\nThe bigger issue with pair programming is it isn't as effective if:\n\n1. The task is too simple\n\nThe leads to boredom and lack of engagement. My teams tried to then \"pick\" which things are too small to pair on, but they kept raising the bar on what that meant. This is likely because given the choice, developers usually tend to prefer to work on things alone (just from my experience).\n\n2. The developers aren't similar skill levels.\n\nIf one developer is senior and the other junior, it can be a good time for mentorship and growth. The senior can practice all of the things associated with teaching, and the junior can learn and grow their skills. However, this seemed to wear thin pretty quickly. If you have two seniors and two juniors, and you always pair a senior with a junior, then the seniors would get frustrated at constantly having to teach and explain everything. It's tough to balance depending on your team structure.\n\nI think the tl;dr is that pairing is heavily dependent on who the pair is. Some of the best coding experiences I've ever had were working on a challenging problem with someone else where we bounced ideas off each other, discussed alternatives, brainstormed, etc...\n\nBut I've had equally bad experiences where my pairing partner or task just wasn't a good fit for pairing.", "author": "MarsJr", "score": 47}

{"id": "ff55kmo", "body": "I was surprised how little this went into code review. My experience with code review has been that it's a much lighter-weight alternative to pair-programming, and much easier to handle remotely (even across timezones) and its asynchronous nature is a huge benefit. There are also advantages to having my work environment set up the way I want -- I use Dvorak, have a bunch of custom keyboard shortcuts, and there's no guarantee I use the same editor/IDE as you; with code review, all we really need to share is a style guide and a code-reviewing tool.\n\nThe article offers some criticisms, but doesn't seem to address these benefits, or even try to explain why pair programming better addresses them.\n\n---\n\nI guess I should talk about the criticisms, then:\n\n> For example, when coder and reviewer rely too much on each other without making that explicit: The coder might defer a few little decisions and improvements, thinking that problems will be caught in the review. While the reviewer then relies on the diligence of the coder, trusting their work and not looking too closely at the code.\n\nI've had pair programming collapse in a similar way: One person drives, the other person basically just says \"Yeah, that looks right.\"\n\n> Another dynamic at play is that of the sunk cost fallacy: We are usually reluctant to cause rework for something that the team already invested in.\n\nI guess the point here is that pair programming would've caught a problem before as much time was invested. But I doubt that's always true -- surely it's possible for a pair to output code that, on reflection, wasn't a good idea and should be reworked? Wouldn't it be *even worse,* knowing two people worked on the thing?\n\nAlso, there's a mitigation for this: Break your change up into smaller pieces. Generally, this makes them easier to review, while also getting you faster feedback on whether you've picked an entirely wrong approach.\n\n> Secondly, a code review process can disrupt the team's flow. Picking up a review task requires a context switch for somebody.\n\nThat isn't how I do it. Again, code reviews should be *asynchronous,* so I'll look at my code review queue at some natural context switch in my day. I don't think I'm alone in that. If there was more to do on this task, I might [pipeline another change after this one and keep working](https://unhashable.com/stacked-pull-requests-keeping-github-diffs-small/), in which case there really isn't much of a context switch. If the change is done, then a context switch was coming anyway.\n\nCompare to pairing, where I'd have to *sync up* context switches. What if my partner is just getting into the flow when I need a bathroom/coffee break? I'm actually genuinely curious to hear from people who've paired more often than I have on this point -- the article discusses ways to deal with these challenges, but doesn't really point them out as disadvantages to pairing.\n\n> With trunk-based development, delayed code reviews are even less effective, because the code changes go into the master branch immediately anyway.\n\nRight, that's why the SOP these days is code review *before* merging changes into the master branch, in the form of pull requests.", "author": "SanityInAnarchy", "score": 2}

I guess Prolog does a lot more, but from what I remember it felt like most things we did was programming LISP backwards. It was fun when you input some facts and Prolog could deduce the answer, but less fun when you had to carefully type in algorithms so that the resolver would end up with the result you know you wanted.

There's also a LISP-based logic programming language in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, which is also very similar to Prolog.\n\nSome Prolog implementations have very sophisticated compilers and parallel/distributed processing facilities, so using a sophisticated (perhaps commercial/proprietary) Prolog implementation instead of the LISP-based logic programming environments, you could get higher performance.\n\nProlog is also homoiconic (like lisps are), so it's trivial to write a Prolog program that interprets Prolog code (even more so than lisp, a Prolog meta-interpreter is a lot shorter).

The 20th-century trend toward smaller families in developed countries continued, however, so the relative impact of the \"baby boom echo\" was generally less pronounced than the post–World War II baby boom.\n\nAlthough Millennial characteristics vary by region, depending on social and economic conditions, the generation is generally marked by an increased use and familiarity with communications, media, and digital technologies.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/coding/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "author": "WikiTextBot", "score": 2}

If they don’t think about those tradeoffs, then it’s basically the same message with curly braces.

Html and xml is processed like a state machine char by char, clients can process a partial response and still get it right without the need for the tag end. In JSON you can’t infer the data until after you see the final curly braces or square brackets.

Currently myself a lot of users use TypeScript to solve this problem but this seems like a more elegant solution to that.  I also like the idea of it being more full stack in your logic.

Although, that is also not always true, some web apps have a lot of content publicly visible. But while SEO and accessibility are connected, not having good SEO does not mean that web page/app/site is not accessible.\n\nAnyway, I get where you are coming from, and while we did not put much focus on accessibility yet (because we are yet missing a lot of other, production-critical features, like deployment :)), we certainly want to make it an important part of Wasp.\n\nActually, Wasp is a lot about creating web apps with best practices, and plan is to have accessibility be a big part of that.\n\nFor example, we want to allow users to define forms declaratively in Wasp, and the promise is going to be that forms code that we generate is going to hold to accessibility standards.\n\nTLDR; we plan to put a lot of effort into accessibility and one of the promises of Wasp will be that if you do a web app via Wasp,  you will get a lot of accessibility done correctly and for free.\n\nThanks for offering to help!

I have two command keys. Check. But now I have a problem. The OS treats command and control as different keys, and I don't have enough modifier keys left over to get two convenient control keys.

I *really* want to be able to use emacs-style readline bindings, but again, that's only convenient if I map Command onto Control, and that makes using the rest of the OS harder (copy/paste, opening and closing tabs, and all the other Mac-style software that wants Command bindings, not control).\n\nCompare this to Linux, where, for example, Control-w kills a region in Emacs *and* closes a tab in a browser. On the mac, you need two different modifier keys, and there aren't enough keys on the keyboard to map them the way I want.", "author": "deong", "score": 5}

Its idea of keybindings is not especially compatible with that of Emacs, and the silly prohibition against running multiple copies of the same binary means you have to fight with it to do things like having a completely separate emacs session with your mail client running alongside another copy for everyday work. Most emacs users probably don't do that, but I like having that separation.

I need to do \"beginning-of-line\" **a lot** in Emacs and the shell, and not having a right-hand control key makes it awkward. So I have to resort to telling Emacs to treat command as control. But all that does is help reinforce the muscle memory that will be incorrect in the rest of the OS.\n\nI freely admit that my problem with OS X (pre-Lion, at least) is that I'm personally not willing to just adjust to the Mac way. I've been using Emacs and a shell for the wrong side of 15 years now.\n\nIn any case, the Mac is consistent only to the degree that you're willing to do what the OS wants you to do. The OS says, \"Control is a little-used modifier compared to Command and Option, so we tuck it down out of the way.\" If you're OK with that, the OS is very consistent.

Mostly, it just comes down to what you cut your teeth on -- that's what's going to feel \"right\".

The reason we use cars instead of horses is because cars permit faster, further, more convenient travel.

{"id": "c2mwd0c", "body": "Right, hopefully I can give you some advice: I left college at 18 and went straight into a web-development job. Several things helped me, most of which I had to learn over time:\n\n**1) ASK FOR HELP.** It is so easy to try and fix a problem by yourself without getting outside help, because you don't want to appear lacking in knowledge or because you want to prove you can do it yourself. Those are short-turn solutions. In a months time, people won't remember that you had to ask three times a week how to do something; they'll remember whether you shipped a working product or not. Obviously this is something that you need to gauge based on your own situation/ability - as a general rule of thumb, if 80% of your question can be answered in the first page of google results, then you should try and do it yourself, but if it's something you have no idea, just ask.\n\n**2) SHOW INITIATIVE. **This extends in several areas. It might be looking through the companies existing code-base to see if they have a particular style of doing something, which you can then emulate. It might be looking at a data-design document and suggesting improvements. Definitely just read everything you can about programming. r/programming is good, as is r/webdev, r/javascript (for the web stuff) as well as numerous other subreddits that will be field-specific. Learn to love coding.\n\n**3) THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE CODING.** Stuff that requires a senior developer to re-write once you've finished is a waste of everybodies time. This doesn't mean that you'll be expected to write perfect code; such a thing arguably doesn't exist, but you can make sure that the way you write makes it easy to change later.\n\n**4) TO BEGIN WITH, COMMENT THINGS. **As a general rule of thumb, it is better to not need coments at all than to spam them. However, if this is your first time writing commercial code, then I would suggest that adding just a few one-line comments, next to non-trivial bits of code, will help anyone who is looking over your work as well as you when you inevitably come back to your code. \n\n**5) CONSIDER CONTEXT.** No project exists in a void. Likewise, no project exists without a deadline. Don't fall into the trap of getting hung-up on the first hurdle, and thus end up neglecting the rest of whatever you have to do. It just places unnecessary stress on you. If this does happen, TELL SOMEONE. If it's your first time in that situation the natural reaction is to think \"I can fix this, no-one needs to know I fucked up\", but that line of thought ultimately helps nobody, least of all you. Your colleagues don't want you to fail, they want to have working code. Remember that.\n\n\nI'd also suggest several other things:\n\n* practice your google-fu\n* practice your ability to concentrate on work without getting distracted by the internet\n* learn your IDE back to front\n* if you haven't already read up on source-control systems \n* follow the ever-living shit out of all general tutorials for the languages you'll be using.\n\nEDIT:\n**Get good programming books**, and read them. I'd highly recommend \"[The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1317118064&sr=8-1)\", and there's a [great Stack Overflow thread on other books to read](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711/what-is-the-single-most-influential-book-every-programmer-should-read).\n\n\nGood luck!", "author": "None", "score": 68}

Automated release builds mean you can have a new (fixed) version ready in minutes rather hours/days. Also, less bugs.\n* Automated pre-release testing\n* HUMAN pre-release testing\n* Proper upgrade methods. Nothing should have to be done manually when actually releasing. Pushing new code/data, database upgrades, etc, etc.\n* Automated Fallback / Rollback mechanisms for when your release fucks everything up and people can't do their work with their new version.\n* Proper hot-patching for quick bugfixes if your project requires it.\n\nIn short, I wish I had learned a shit-tonne more about automating **everything**. The things above tie in heavily with testing, the good use of a decent version control system and bug/issue reporting system.\n\nOther things I wish I knew beforehand:\n\n* How to deal with (difficult) customers\n* Don't promise all kinds of shit if you're not 100% certain you can deliver. Most requests made by managers/customers are bullshit, don't add anything to the software and take huge amounts of your time. Once promised, you've got to deliver. Customers can be restrained from making ridiculous requests with the big ol' scary \"that'll cost you X dollars\"; managers with \"that'll cost X amount of time\", where X is some absurdly large (yet within reason) figure.\n* If you work for The Man, *never* do overtime, EVER. (this can be hard if you live in the U.S. Elsewhere, you can just refuse; it's normal) It is a never-ending cycle. Overtime is a sign of *bad project management and planning*. By doing overtime, you're not addressing the root of the problem, you're merely putting bandages on a arterial bleeding wound.\n\nSome techy things I learned early on that have made my life a lot easier:\n\n* Use as many command-line things as you can. Commandline is often superior because they can be easily automated. Automating clicking around in your IDE is a real bitch. Also, IDE's do things \"under the hood\" which you may not be aware of. Nothing is more frustrating than not having your project compile properly because you switched to the next version of your IDE. \n* Use as much plain text as you possibly can. Plain text can be viewed anywhere, everywhere. It is easy to keep track of in Version Control, as opposed to Word/Excel files, etc. Plain text can be easily read by programs which, again, leads to easier automation. You can do much more with text than you think. Generate end-user documentation, keep translation data (gettext), generate graphs/diagrams (gnuplot/graphviz), etc.\n\nI've got a million things more, but I'll leave it at this for now.\n\n**TL;DR**: Learn how to automate everything. Store shit in plain text.\n\n*edit*: Forgot the usual disclaimer: Whenever I say \"NEVER\", I don't mean never. There are exceptions to everything.

This article, however, is crap.\n\n>C is a concise language, and in its 45 years of existence, it has cemented its place as an essential tool in any programmer’s arsenal.\n\nNot really. The vast majority of coders out there will never have a need to touch C. It has a wide range of application, but it's far from \"an essential tool in any programmer's arsenal\", and certainly pales in terms of generic usefulness as compared to a scripting language like Python.\n\n>Most of the critical parts of the OS you’re using right now were (far more likely than not) written in C, and when it comes to, say, a chip in a refrigerator, you simply cannot use modern languages like Java or Python.\n\nTrue, but the vast majority of coders are not working in the embedded industry or, even then, at a level low-enough level to require C.\n\n>While that code is often also written in Assembly\n\nIt's really not. I've been writing embedded software full-time for the last 20 years and, while I certainly have written assembly code on occasion -- when writing a bootloader or porting an RTOS or supporting atomic operations -- it's extremely rare and comprises a very small percentage of the overall project code. And the vast majority of embedded software engineers never even do those things.\n\n>Why? it teaches you something really important: planning your programs out. With C code, there’s no going into a program without fully knowing what it’s going to do at every step of the way\n\nUtter bullshit. If you don't know how to create a well-crafted C program _without_ first \"knowing what it’s going to do at every step of the way\" then you don't know C that well, or you are creating a very simple program. Rapid prototyping is just as practical with C as with any other language.\n\n>Finally, it’s worth mentioning that learning C won’t be a complete waste of time if you don’t use it because it is transferable knowledge (so you might use it for something else!). C has been so popular that it has inspired a whole host of languages (dubbed “C-Style languages”), which use its syntactic conventions. Have you heard of C++, Java and C#? these are frequently used languages, all inspired by C. When you learn C, you gain a basic understanding of the flow of these languages and how they run, though all of them bring some or the other changes which make them unique. So, if you’re interested in programming, C is a great place to start.\n\nBut this works the other way just as easily; the syntactic similarities between C and C++, Java and C# mean your knowledge is just as \"transferable\" if you learn one of those other languages first and then move to C.", "author": "mojosam", "score": 70}

{"id": "ek97ps7", "body": "I really think it depends on what the student's goals are.\n\n## Python\n\nPython can be great for writing things quickly, primarily because Python is essentially executable pseudocode. This is great at an introductory stage because a student can to straight from paper/notes to code with minimal overhead.\n\nPython also has a very robust standard library. Learning Python as a beginner can be hugely empowering, because you can quickly get the feeling of \"I can do anything!\", which is great for building a positive outlook on programming.\n\nBut I really think the dynamic type system is a huge detriment to early students, because it leads to frustration. Instead of compiling and immediately getting an error telling them their code is bad, they have to spend a ton of time learning to write good tests to make sure the checks will happen at runtime. While this will be fine for some students, I think overall it's not great for an introduction.\n\n## Java\n\nMany universities (including my alma mater) start with Java. Java's primary benefit over Python for the student is, I think, the static type system: a student can run the compiler and immediately find out whether their code is at least type-correct.\n\nThat said, Java's greatest detriment is probably its type system — specifically that it features manifest typing: you have to specify the type of every little thing. Recent versions have started moving away from this, but most Java any student is likely to read will be full of boilerplate and overly verbose type declarations all over the place. This can quickly give the feeling of \"Surely we can do better than this\" (because we most certainly can).\n\nI also don't like Java's enforcement of literally everything belonging to a class. While OOP can be a powerful tool when used correctly, I think Java encourages a style of programming that is detrimental in the long term. Not everything needs to be modeled in terms of inheritance hierarchies, and teaching a beginner \"This is how programming works\" with regard to this style is a recipe for long-term problems.\n\n## Type Systems\n\nSo for me, a lot of it comes down to type systems. I think types are a hugely empowering thing to learn about, because they give you a more precise manner by which to think about the code. So what's the ideal type system for a beginner (in my opinion)?\n\nFirst and foremost, the language should be *statically typed* — meaning the student gets immediate feedback on type information at compile time instead of runtime.\n\nSecondly, I think the language should be *strongly typed*. This is actually a poor phrase that we should phase out these days, but essentially I mean that the language should not make it overly easy for a user to shoot themselves in the foot. C is a weakly typed language by nearly any account because of all the silly things you can do with pointers and casting. Java is a very strongly typed language, but all types are implicit optional types (meaning you can stick `null` anywhere, leading to every Java user's favorite `NullPointerException`). Ideally, I'd like something with a very expressive type system that does not have these sorts of pitfalls.\n\nAnd lastly, I'd prefer a language with type inference so the student isn't required to write out every single type for every variable and class. We have algorithms to figure this stuff out for us by context!\n\nSo what (not-unheard-of) languages meet these criteria? A few. Haskell, OCaml, and Swift come to mind immediately, and there are probably plenty of others that I'm not as personally familiar with.\n\n## Other Considerations\n\nOne of the other important factors is that the language should not be overly difficult to learn. Haskell meets all my criteria with regard to type systems, but trying to learn Haskell as a novice programmer would be like getting your driving learner's permit via Formula 1. Is it possible? Yes. Sometimes exhilarating, when things go right? Probably. But overwhelmingly you'll have the feeling of \"oh my god I am so not qualified for this\".\n\nAnother factor is development support. Some language implementations feature really good tooling (helpful errors, fast compile times, easy package management for installing additional features, etc.), and some have bad tooling (don't get me started on some of the Haskell type errors hahaha). This is much more about the language implementation itself than anything like IDEs. (I started using text editors instead of IDEs and I think that helped me a lot in terms of learning how to think about implementing a program, but I missed out on features like debugging and progressive syntax checking that could have been helpful without being a detriment.)\n\nAnd then lastly: functional vs. imperative. Many programmers learn imperative languages first, try to learn a functional language, feel frustrated, and stick to imperative forevermore. Then, when they're asked what to start a new programmer on, they assert that imperative style is the more logical style and that it's the easiest way to learn blah blah blah. It's all just personal anecdote. I've seen students struggle with sequencing logic just as much as anything else, so I don't think imperative programming is inherently easier to understand. Some schools use functional languages for their introductory courses, and I think there's a lot of potential there (type systems are generally \"better\", in my opinion, and they teach reasoning at the data level instead of the procedure level, which I think is a more helpful mental model in the long term). But many of these languages lack community support and solid standard libraries, or are otherwise unwieldy in some way that makes them (I think) poor choices for beginners. But I think it's something that we could potentially improve over the years.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo what language would I start somebody on?\n\nIn terms of the language itself... Swift, honestly. I think the type system is appropriately expressive, and the standard library is pretty complete (including lots of capability for GUI programming, which is a big boon for some people for sure). The community is large and very active, so it's easy to get help for things. I also like that not everything has to be in a class, and I'm an especially big fan of internal and external parameter names (which is a pretty minor feature in the grand scheme of things, but one that I really really love).\n\nBut... Swift doesn't work well on Windows, I think (though it is on Linux now), which can be a detriment to a newbie coming from that environment. And the lack of ABI stability up to this point has definitely hindered adoption to some extent. The compiler errors are significantly better now than they used to be, but they still leave something to be desired sometimes. And there's something wrong with their type inference algorithm, because sometimes you can get a non-terminating evaluation (which is very bad haha).\n\nSo in the meantime, I guess one of Java or Python, depending on the individual student or needs of the course. I'd lean more towards Python, and maybe encourage using MyPy for static type-checking at the very least. Hopefully Swift will continue to gain adoption on other platforms, and as ABI stability is guaranteed from 5.0 onwards (I think? Haven't checked recently if that's still the case) it'll start to settle down and really flourish, I hope. So maybe in a few years Swift will be my recommendation, but for now I would be hesitant (unless the student is very intent on developing iOS or macOS applications, I suppose).\n\n---\n\nThat's probably more than you bargained for in a response, but I work in PL research so I think about this stuff a lot haha.

I think someone can succeed in any of a number of different ways and still not be good at C, or not have learned C as their first language. We shouldn't be seeking to build walls of elitism around the field; we should be tearing down the walls that are already there to welcome anybody who wants in.\n\n>\tAs for needing to understand memory, unless you’re doing pointer arithmetic, you can just think of it like “malloc / realloc / free are how I manage memory manually.”\n\nI mean that everything is very explicit in C. Arrays don't really exist — they're just pointers, which are a magic set of values that are like normal values except they correspond to a different level of the storage hierarchy. And you have to deal with pointers to get around call-by-value semantics. You also have to deal with pointers to do anything with \"strings\" (which also don't really exist), and practically every call you'll make into the standard library or system will require using pointers.\n\nSure, you could just choose not to explain what pointers are and tell students \"You'll learn that when you're older\", but I think that's an incredibly unsatisfying approach.

Experiencing the boundary is a direct way to learn about boundaries and then disciplines.\n\nNo, I disagree.\n\nWhen you \"shoot yourself in the foot\", it means you've done something that's set back your progress. It's when *you* are your own barrier to learning.\n\nIn this context, I was talking about languages which make it *easy* to shoot yourself in the foot. By this I mean that they have features which lure beginners into making mistakes that impede their ability to progress further in their learning. The key her is that the language has something about it which essentially *tricks* the novice programmer into doing things the wrong way.\n\nI don't think introductory languages should be built this way. A good introductory language should not make the beginner feel like they've been misled or lied to, or otherwise tricked into believing something which isn't true.\n\nLack of type safety is a good example. Languages which are unsafe can cause beginners to walk down a path where they write code that they don't fully understand (with regard to the types). This, in turn, causes them to eventually reach a point where they feel completely lost and hopeless. Is this necessary? No. A language with a good, safe, static type system can clue the programmer in early on and tell them \"Hey, don't go that way — you won't like it down there.\" This is a feature which *prevents* a beginner shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nLearning through adversity is great, but being put against problems that you lack the context to understand at an early stage is not super helpful. Some people push through just fine, I guess, but there are plenty more who feel frustrated and quit. This is not the sort of language design we should be choosing to show our beginners, in my opinion.", "author": "DonaldPShimoda", "score": 1}

Some members of the specifications committee--including C.A.R. Hoare and Niklaus Wirth--protest its approval. ALGOL 68 proves difficult to implement.\"*\n\nIt is sometimes attributed to either Edsger Dijkstra and/or C. A. R. Hoare - both were on the Algol68 design committee, and both are Algol60 compiler writers (& vendors?).\n\nIFAIK neither used the of these guys actually used the word \"bloated\", the closest I could find was \"monster\" in CAR Hoare's 1981 Turing address: \"At last, in December 1968, in a mood of black depression, I attended the meeting in Munich at which our long-gestated monster was to come to birth and receive the name ALGOL 68. \" Comm ACM 24(2), 75-83 (1981)\n\nCAR Hoare went on to say:\n*\"The principles of modularity, or orthogonality, insofar as they contribute to overall simplicity, are an excellent means to an end; but as a substitute for simplicity they are very questionable. Since in practice they have proved to be a technically more difficult achievement than simplicity, it is foolish to adopt them as primary objectives.\"*\n\nThe above quote seems to suggest that Algol68 was terse, not bloated. And so.... Andrew Ferguson - in 2000 - seems to have effectively \"retrospectively\" coined the *\"bloated Algol68\"* meme.  Maybe Andrew Ferguson has not read the C99 spec, or used the \".NET Framework\"...", "author": "NevilleDNZ", "score": 2}

If the function hasn't been called yet, it compiles it on-demand.\n\nNow, at this point, Julia knows *exactly* what the types of the arguments are, so it can compile a specialized version of the function.  Even further, it uses abstract interpretation to do type inference on the body of the function and the functions it calls.  This allows it to concretely reason about the types of all the variables within the function, enabling all sorts of optimizations like doing the dynamic dispatch at compile-time, specialized and un-boxed storage, inlining of functions, etc.  If not, though, no biggie — it'll just use boxed and tagged storage.  You have to pay the cost of dynamic function dispatch at that point… but when you're inside that next function you're back to specialized code once again.\n\nThere are a whole host of introspection utilities that allow you to ensure your code is \"type-stable\" and amenable to these optimizations.

So no hand-written inline assembly.\n\n> Why OCaml and why the metageneration of code?\n\nWhen FFTW was written OCaml was the most popular member of the MetaLanguage family of programming languages that are specifically bred for metaprogramming (writing programs that do things with other programs) so they chose OCaml to write their metaprogram.\n\nThey wrote it as a metaprogram because it requires a huge amount of very mechnically-written code (i.e. \"codelets\" for FFTs of size 2, 3, 4, 5...) to be pulled together and benchmarked in different combinations in order to decide upon the best strategy to do an FFT of a given size on a given machine. That is prohibitively difficult to do by hand. Previous alternatives typically used a single generic solution that is slower in almost all cases (except perhaps some special cases like integral powers of two).\n\nThe features of OCaml that are good for metaprogramming also make it good for solving symbolic problems. At one point, the world record for largest symbolic problem ever solved on a supercomputer was held by an OCaml program.\n\nI was first exposed to this in my group at the Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge back around the turn of the millenium. I was one of the last in our group to switch to OCaml. Since then I've largely jumped ship to F# which is a similar language. Never looked back. I don't use low-level languages like C or C++ any more any I don't use dynamic languages like Python any more because I get the best of both worlds with F#: high-level brevity and low-level performance.

Good candidates rarely even get this question because they've already written the n algorithm.  Bad candidates struggle to even identify that it is n^2 or why it is n^2.

{"id": "fs0mrec", "body": "A [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)-decoder based architecture for generating music. \n\n### Samples\n\nYou can listen to all the samples [here](https://soundcloud.com/galacticglum/sets/ramblings-of-a-transformer). The code is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/galacticglum/composer).\n\n### High-level overview\nFundamentally, this problem can be phrased into one nearly identical to text generation: we have some sequential data (that is both temporally and spatially relevant) and we want to generate more in the same style. Text generation works by treating the problem as a massive classification, and it essentially approximates a probability distribution function giving how likely a word is to come some next. In particular, it does this for the whole vocabulary (that is, the set of all possible elements that may occur next. In the case of text, this is often a token).\n\nMusic is actually very similar to text when you really think about it. It has both temporal and spatial information and is structured in a fairly unitary way (i.e. measures, phrases, motifs)—similar to how text is (sentences, paragraphs, etc...). *So....*we phrase our problem in a very similar way.\n\n### Data format\nWe use the serialization scheme proposed in (Oore, et al., 2018) as the basis of our data encoding.\n\nThe MIDI note events are converted into a sequence of events from the following vocabulary:\n\n* 128 NOTE_ON events for indicating the start of a note with one of 128 MIDI pitches.\n* 128 NOTE_OFF events for indicating the end of a note with one of 128 MIDI pitches.\n* 100 TIME_SHIFT events for representing a movement forward in time in 10 ms increment (possible values range from 10 ms to 1 s).\n* 32 VELOCITY events for representing the velocity of the next NOTE_ON events in the form of 128 possible MIDI velocities quantized into 32 bins.\n\n\nFor example, consider a simplified scheme where there are only 4 pitches, 10 possible time shift increments, and 4 velocity bins:\n\n\n* 4 NOTE_ON events for indicating the start of a note with one of 4 pitches.\n* 4 NOTE_OFF events for indicating the end of a note with one of 4 pitches\n* 10 TIME_SHIFT events for representing a movement in time in 1 ms increment (possible values range from 1 ms to 10 ms).\n* 4 VELOCITY events for representing the velocity of the next NOTE_ON events in the form of 128 possible MIDI velocities quantized into 4 bins: 1-32, 33-64, 65-96, 97-128.\n\n\nIn this simplified example, a single step consists of a 22-dimensional one-hot vector. [Figure 1](https://puu.sh/FPunp/c52d6c87f6.png) illustrates the structure of one of these vectors and [Figure 2](https://puu.sh/FPunN/76c59b7f55.png) illustrates an example MIDI file encoded as a series of these one-hot vectors.\n\nIn the scheme presented by (Oore, et al., 2018), the MIDI files are first preprocessed by extending note durations in segments where the sustain pedal is active. The sustain pedal is considered to be active (or down) if it is within a value of less than 64. On the other hand, it is considered to be inactive (or up) if it is above a value of 64. All notes within a period of time where the sustain pedal is active are extended so that they span the entirety of the sustain pedal period or to the start of the next note of the same pitch, whichever happens first. This however, removes the expressiveness that sustain pedals may have on the performance, and it means that there is no way to distinguish note length from sustains in the final output; on the other hand, VSTi plugins and other musical renderers distinguish between these two events—for they are intrinsically separate features. Thus, we introduce two new verbs into the event-based description:\n\n* A SUSTAIN_ON event indicating that the sustain pedal is down.\n* A SUSTAIN_OFF event indicating that the sustain pedal is up.\n\nTherefore, with the added sustain events, the whole encoding consists of a 390-dimensional one-hot vector.\n\n## The problem with one-hot vectors\nBy design, one-hot vectors are sparse vectors which contain a lot of redundancies. As the dimensionality of our data increases, we find that training a model on these one-hot vectors becomes more and more challenging---requiring a substantial amount of GPU memory. Instead, we use an [Embedding](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/182775/what-is-an-embedding-layer-in-a-neural-network) layer. An embedding acts as a lookup table between the input integer event ids and a dense float-vector representation of these ids, which it learns during training. This allows us to reduce the size of the input space by 'squeezing' it into a smaller dimension (for example, we could convert a vocabulary size of 256 into 64 using embedding layers, meaning a 4 times reduction in the input space size).", "author": "GalacticGlum", "score": 8}

LEFT or RIGHT is the best this subarray could contribute leftward or rightward. MAX could be construed as \"the maximum element of this range\" so I might call that MAXSUM. SUM is the total of this whole range. Then follow up by including that once we have two matrices for adjacent subarrays, you can calculate the matrix for the subarray consisting of both together, in O(1) time. And also, the reason why having the matrix representing the whole array gets you what you want - MAX (or MAXSUM) for the whole array is the target result.\n\nAlso, an explanation of why this is O(n) might be good.\n\n\\- the operations to make the inital matrices is O(n) - one for each array element.\n\n\\- the total operations to combine two of these is O(1), and layer-by-layer we do it for N + N/2 + N/4 + ... = 2N (if people don't get this summation, it's easy to understand with two pie charts)\n\n\\- this gets us O(n) + O(n), and when we let the constants fall out, this is in O(n).\n\nLastly: when you're saying Why is divide-and-conquer better? You might want to say: with N machines available for processing, the Processing required for handling this is O(n), but... the Time required to get a result is actually just the number of layers in the tree, since the parallel processing is happening simultaneously. So, we get a result in O(log(n)) time, for a problem where using synchronous computing would be just O(n).", "author": "pangalgargblast", "score": 3}

I think it's key to clarify what one or change means. At least where I work change means change in requirements. And applying S means grouping bodies of domain knowledge together wherein those groups (1) change independently of other groups and (2) the group of knowledge change closely as a whole when a change is needed. In this way, it's ok for a class to do multiple very closely related things, since it's one body of knowledge.\n\nFrom experience, the most common mistake is to build classes across groups of knowledge, because those classes belong to a single programmatic step that is coincidentally common at the time it was written. Then when one subdomain changes in a different direction, you have to build a more complex structure to make it work vs. just having multiple classes per subdomain.

For example, there are common categories in an application where requirements change independently:\n\n* Business contexts - Sometimes business objects appear in two separate contexts (e.g., payroll context and accounting context). So, it's crucial to ask what business context a requirement belongs to before creating your classes. It should be possible to make changes to the internal logic of a business context without breaking the others.\n\n* User roles - An administrator creating an order has different privileges and rules compared to a customer creating an order. So it's better to use separate those two since the workflow of an administrator can change independently of the customer's workflow and vice versa, even if they involve doing the same thing which is creating an order.\n\n* Third-party integrations - If you integrate with different third-parties for the same service (e.g., different store fronts), then it's better to separate your classes based on the third-party service and avoid the trap of assuming whatever is common among them will remain as is.\n\nThose are the major categories off the top of my head.

This is like saying that one paragraph of written text is \"too much,\" and we need a paragraph break after every ten words.\n\n> For instance, we create includesWholeWord() that wraps the regular expression matching and includesPartialWord() that wraps the string matching [...] Then, we create a matchQuery() function that calls either includeWholeWord() or includePartialWord() according to the query options [...]\n\nCreating entire functions that wrap a single regex and a built-in String method, with names that just restate what these two things do, hardly seems any better than writing a code comment that describes what the code does and not why.\n\nThe function we're using as an example, `handleSearchQuery`, received a search query as a string paired with a separate options argument. It is entirely reasonable for this function to perform string operations on its own, because one of the inputs it's acting on *is a string.* If you have multiple systems that need to handle search queries and options consistently, then you might separate that handling out into another function to be called by different kinds of searches, but even then, you'd be separating things out for a different reason than whether things are or are not sufficiently \"high-level.\" The notion of \"high-level\" and \"low-level\" concerns can be useful, but \"relevant\" and \"irrelevant\" concerns seem far more useful.\n\nNever mind that the description given for \"high-level\" and \"low-level\" concerns isn't accurate:\n\n> The problem with this code is that it mixes low-level concerns like regular expressions and string matching with high-level concerns like filtering the elements of an array.\n\nFiltering an array can absolutely be a \"low-level\" concern. The author's motivation for making the distinction that they have seems to have less to do with the specific operations and more to do with what they're being performed on: parsing the search query is a means to one of our ends; filtering an array *of things we are searching* is an end in itself.\n\n> function shouldReverse\n> \n> function maybeReverse\n\nIf the author has been following Bob Martin's advice on \"clean\" code, [the best thing they can do is work very hard to forget all of it](https://qntm.org/clean).\n\n> When you give descriptive names to your functions, the code describes itself.\n\nThis is true, but the author is using it as a form of rules-lawyering to work around the \"don't write comments that just blindly restate what the code does\" rule.

{"id": "gr10cvp", "body": "What this doesn't note that's important - in practice, GraphQL is an overly complex protocol even for the problem domain it is intended to solve (reduction of over-fetching), which leads to complicated parsers and query planners. This leads to slow parsing, followed by slow planning, followed by slow execution; in my experience using out of the box GraphQL libraries such as graphene, the performance hit from using GraphQL on the server _significantly_ outweighs the performance improvement from the tailored result, ignoring the fact that with REST you can avoid over-fetching as well.\n\nFurthermore, GraphQL essentially breaks caching, which is itself also likely to outweigh any performance improvement. Sabotaging caching from your API endpoints from the get-go is a serious defect: micro-caching alone can reduce the majority of server processing times to sub-millisecond with only a minor consistency cost, which is negligible in 90% of situations with a bit of forethought.\n\nFurthermore, with http/2 adoption widespread, and QUIC support gaining traction, overfetching/underfetching in REST is _much_ less of an issue than it used to be, because the cost of underfetching has been reduced. \n\nIn practice, on a modern tech stack (i.e., a browser that supports at least http/2, and your server supports at least http/2), there is almost no penalty for making two small requests rather than 1 large request.\n\nHence, one can modify REST slightly to include the same single responsibility principle that apply to traditional programming / gRPC, and you won't need to update APIs unless there is some significant change in the data, and when you do few things will need to change.", "author": "Tjstretchalot", "score": 72}

{"id": "gr1x17u", "body": "Sure:\n\nIf you have a webapp that serves a directory of comments, one might have an endpoint `GET /api/comments/hot`, which returns a listing of the popular comments right now. Let's suppose there are no arguments to this endpoint, and cookies are ignored as this endpoint is public.\n\nWe can also assume that it's not critical that the response for this endpoint be perfectly up-to-date. Let's suppose we only want to recalculate once per minute.\n\nThis problem is so common there's a ton of tooling around it. We've gone through two iterations of it: [Etag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag) were the first, followed by the more modern [Cache-Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control).\n\nIf we return the header `Cache-Control: public, max-age=60` we are stating that the response to this endpoint is valid for 60 seconds, and it doesn't depend on private information.\n\nA typical web stack might be as follows:\n\n    Client\n    ^\n    v\n    Reverse Proxy (e.g., Nginx)\n    ^\n    v\n    Webapp\n\nWhere the TLS connection is re-established between each link. If you have a CDN layer, it would go between the Client and Reverse Proxy and also re-establish TLS. In most setups the Reverse Proxy speaks to the Webapp within a private network and hence does not require TLS. Hence, each layer is opaquely trusted, and can see the raw value of the request, without any untrusted layers being able to see the values of the request.\n\nThe reverse proxy and CDN will thus be able to, and will almost always, inspect the headers, see the `Cache-Control`, and store the response of the request where the key is the URL of the request (`GET /api/comments/hot`). On future requests, if the cached value is still valid, it will return the cached content immediately rather than going down to the next layer. `Cache-Control` is sophisticated and has many layers for fine-grained control, e.g., `must-revalidate`, `stale-while-revalidate`, ect.\n\nHowever, the key part is that there is a common request with a common key, so this mapping makes sense\n\n    Key: GET /api/comments/hot\n    Value: response body + headers\n\nAs you can see, the more granular the paths the less effective this gets. But even worse, the key must include anything that affects the response. So if there is a _request body_ which effects the response, the key will have to include the request body. If the request body does not have an extremely fixed format (e.g., down to the ordering of keys and spacing), a Hash lookup of like this is going to be useless. The same applies if the request body is put into a query parameter.\n\nWell, a complicated query parameter is exactly how GraphQL works: https://graphql.org/learn/serving-over-http/#get-request\n\nIf the query parameters differ at all between requests, it has to be included in the key of the cache, which increases the likelihood of cache misses, and in the extreme might result in worse performance than no caching at all.\n\nAnd if you are using GraphQL but you require that all clients MUST use the same exact query for the same request, i.e., queries should never by dynamically generated, than all you have is an extremely unwieldy version of a REST endpoint.", "author": "Tjstretchalot", "score": 41}
{"id": "gr4rmac", "body": "First thing to note is to ensure that http/2 will only help you will requests going to the same domain. So if those requests are actually being delegated out to a bunch of different domains for aggregation (e.g., an internal aggregation tool that is fetching information from 50 different websites), and you switch from making those calls on the server to on the client, you'll see a massive penalty as the client has to handshake with all those websites. This may be obvious but I think it's important to get that out of the way.\n\nSo let's assume you have one large request on server A that you want to split up to a large number of requests on server A. The most pertinent thing to be mindful of is to ensure your headers are properly able to be compressed. If you have wildly different headers between each small request that will require actually uploading the headers individually per request which could be quite a lot of bandwidth from the user. Crucially, this means be careful if these requests are manipulating cookies.\n\nAssuming your headers are either identical between requests or differ by a small amount, the headers will be compressed using [HPAC](https://blog.cloudflare.com/hpack-the-silent-killer-feature-of-http-2/) and so each GET request is a tiny packet sent to the server.\n\nFurthermore, it's again worth verifying you are really using http/2 through nearly the entire chain. This is most likely to come up if you are switching from TLS to raw HTTP between the load balancer and a custom reverse proxy. For example, if you use AWS Application Load Balancer to manage https, and have that go to Nginx, which then goes to the webapp, it's very natural to use http/1.1 on Nginx. However this could incur a significant penalty on Nginx: managing an enormous number of unnecessary connections wastes a significant amount of memory and CPU. This is not terrible, since you can scale the Nginx fleet horizontally, but the more you do so the less effective that fleet becomes at caching.\n\nHowever, if you are confident your requests are going through as http/2 all the way up to (but usually not including) the worker fleet (as the worker fleet is not likely to be limited by # of connections before it is limited by processing the requests), then you can think of http/2 requests as essentially multiplexed packets on a single live connection:\n\n\n    Open Connection\n    TLS Handshake\n    Client: GET /api/foo\n    Client: GET /api/foo2\n    ...\n    Server: Response to /api/foo\n    Server: Response to /api/foo2\n    Close Connection\n\nSince it's more accurate to think of requests over http/2 as *packet-backed* call and response, not *connection-based* call and response, it's definitely more appropriate to do 50 small requests. The most top-of-mind example is video games: nobody purposely designs a video game communication protocol that would use 1 100kb packet over 50 2kb packets.\n\nThe main penalty that we get with the many small requests, at this point, is the main motivation for http/3, and has to do with when the clients connection to the server is extremely unreliable or congested, causing packet loss. Instead of using TCP, which requires _strict_ packet ordering, it uses QUIC, literally, \"Quick **UDP** Internet Connections\", which relaxes the packet ordering requirement by allowing the use of individual streams which have independent packet ordering requirements.\n\nI would argue that this penalty is more than acceptable for switching that request from 1 large request down to a reasonable number, say less than 400, small requests right now. However, I would be wary about regularly doing more than 400 small requests on a page until you and most clients are able to support QUIC, or another protocol meant to handle the packet reordering issue.\n\nAll of this is assuming that there is good engineering sense in the client getting a lot of information for that page. If this is a business analytics page this likely makes sense. If this is your signed out landing page, it definitely does not.

Depending on how your application is architected, e.g., if you really are opening a new DB connection every request, this could further increase the target amount of processing per request.\n\nThis, however, has nothing to do with the client or the protocol.

GraphQL API is self-documenting. This is absolutely huge and simplifies the development by a magnitude of 10. I know there are tools like Swagger that \"connect\" with REST API endpoints but the biggest constant struggle with REST development is simply coming up with URIs. With GrahpQL, you have a single URL to work with (do not underestimate this point), and once you know where the API is defined, you know exactly everything about that API and what it supports. You know which parameters are optional, which ones are required, how each object is related, and how to find them. No additional libraries required, all from a mandatory schema file that you must define when working with GraphQL.\n\nAgain, I'm not stating that GQL is better than REST, each has its advantages and disadvantages.

{"id": "gsu4a5a", "body": "> You can run GraphQL via HTTP GET, and then it caches just as any HTTP GET request.\n\nYou are correct, it _can_ cache just like any HTTP GET request. But not all HTTP GET requests are equally cacheable.\n\nIn a REST endpoint, with careful design, one can be extremely cache friendly. For public information which changes infrequently, often it's possible to service all clients with a shared cache at the reverse proxy and/or CDN level. The cache is usually a time-expiring key-value store, where the key contains everything relevant to the response. This means that if you are doing GraphQL over HTTP, clearly the GraphQL query string is relevant.\n\nThis means that any minor differences in the query string, down to spacing and order of keys, will affect the cache. This is what I mean by \"sabotaging\" caching - the protocol encourages semantically equivalent requests which are syntactically different, which makes caching more difficult.\n\n> You can also semantically cache content in the client, which is best for most apps.\n\nThis is definitely an option, but then:\n\n- It's impossible to invalidate caches on the fly, meaning cache durations are naturally forced shorter, unless you also implement a caching hints, whereupon you are reinventing Cache-Control but likely worse.\n- It's a maintenance headache to ensure all the clients are consistent in how they cache, e.g., if you have a web frontend, ios client, and android client. Cache-Control is fairly universally supported.\n- It requires upgrading clients to change caching strategies. \n- Your caching implementation will almost certainly be slower than the built-in ones, especially considering clients (e.g. browsers) have native support for Cache-Control and thus access resources that are not normally available.\n- Your tooling will almost certainly be worse, e.g., busting the cache on the client.\n\n> Only if you don't consider the costs of N+1 on your server. For a very large N. The smaller the response, the larger the N to get all you need.\n\nFrom the server perspective, it may or may not cost you more to service 100 small requests compared to 1 large request. I've certainly had situations where it's faster to respond to 100 small requests in total server time, and scenarios where the opposite is true. That's beyond what one can investigate from just the protocol standpoint, but is something important to consider.\n\nIndeed if _every_ object requires a database hit you've done an N+1 lookup. With the inclusion of caching, this is often not the case. For example, suppose objects A-D tend to be in a cache, and object E tends not to be. A request for objects C-E could be done as a single request, in which it will not be cached at all as require a large database hit, or as 3 requests (C, D, E), in which only E will require a small database hit. In essence you have a linear number of caches rather than the number of permutations if the requests are split up, _in cases where this type of caching is possible_.\n\n> Also, despite HTTP/2 doing their best to cache headers and so on, HTTP request is still of considerable size. To say there's no cost in doing small requests when the payload is smaller than the protocol cruft is inaccurate.\n\nYes there is some balance to be had, if the body packets are below the TCP window size (a few kb) it's likely to impact performance. \n\n---\n\nIn practice though, I'm curious - have you had good luck with performance in GraphQL on the server?

There is _some_ overhead, but it's on the order of around 70 bits / frame. Simplifying somewhat, you need at least 2 frames for a request inside an existing connection. Using HPACK compression on identical headers, of which the great majority are in the [static table](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7541.html#appendix-A), which is the typical case of many small requests, the individual header packets will contain 4 bytes/header (the integer key in the appropriate lookup table).\n\nEverything will be going through SSL, so it's more complicated to calculate the true number of bytes across the network, but lets say, comfortably, that the overhead is about 128 bytes / request.\n\nIn 100 requests, that works out to 12.8kb of extra data. Assuming 2kb payloads, that's 12.8kb of padding out of a total transfer size of about 212.8kb, or 6% overhead.\n\nIs that 6% going to be significant? Possibly, possibly not. Furthermore, there are improvements underway to reduce this amount further in http/3. However, nearly all APIs use JSON, and the padding on that exceeds 6% in almost all cases. Furthermore, I'd argue most APIs have well over 6% padding in stuff like large request uuids for debugging convenience. And debugging an error in a small request is generally easier than one in a large request.\n\n> I use a library to parse it, but not to materialize it. People slap libraries they don't understand on their servers, then complain the problem is in GraphQL. GraphQL isn't a library, it's not a server, it's a query syntax.\n\nI agree with this, but as a query syntax, it's complex and arduous: https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/ - making it challenging to do common operations without an N+1 query:\n\n- Validating the user has access to all resources requested, prior to fetching those resources.\n- Predicting the amount of work a request will take (ratelimiting, charging, reasonableness checking)\n- Combining similar requests for profiling / logging.\n\nIn fact, I don't necessarily disagree that some protocol that accomplishes what GraphQL itself sets out to accomplish may be helpful, but _simple is better_, and GraphQL is _not_ a simple query language. Not for clients, and not for the server. It's also does not lend itself to optimized queries. The protocol seemingly begs both the client and server to think in query-per-row, especially when using nested queries. This often leads to either:\n\n- Not respecting the full spec, fragmenting clients.\n- Error-prone materialization, especially as it relates to DOS vulnerabilities\n\nSince you materialize by hand, which is what I had figured was the only sane way to do it, are you able to handle nested queries without resorting to awkward materializer functions like [graphql-batch](https://github.com/Shopify/graphql-batch), which were designed _because_ the protocol tends to lead to N+1 queries?\n\n\n---\n\n\nBacking out a bit, given the goal of just simplifying outputs - how do you feel about a protocol that just standardizes the \"plucking\" part of a response, where there is one endpoint per resource (for querying), which will always return an array of objects, each with a certain set of keys. The client must choose which keys they selecting.\n\nThis is what most people think of when they think of GraphQL I believe. A protocol limited to that, in my opinion, would be a very competitive extension to REST / standard HTTP, would be fast to parse, and would be fast to materialize. You could add basic discoverability in this system as well. That part of GraphQL I think is great, it's just all the other fluff, like a whole type system, which I think outweighs the benefits.", "author": "Tjstretchalot", "score": 2}

It's just a set of nested select states with few parameters as a filters, that's most of it.\n\n> It's also does not lend itself to optimized queries.\n\nOptimized queries where the server decides what to optimize without regard to what the client needs ends up usually backfiring when the client needs to make series of \"optimized queries\" in order to use 20% of the data, and throw the rest away.\n\nContrary to this, GraphQL allows the client to express their needs and you can then see at the server what the common patterns are and optimize for this.\n\nSo REST is the one that doesn't lend itself to optimized queries, because it ignores half of the story, GraphQL takes into account both sides of the story.\n\n> Backing out a bit, given the goal of just simplifying outputs - how do you feel about a protocol that just standardizes the \"plucking\" part of a response, where there is one endpoint per resource (for querying), which will always return an array of objects, each with a certain set of keys.

Instead the server also would need to do 2 roundtrips to SQL or whatever it uses. A GraphQL combined query could be served by one combined SQL query.\n- Looks like I'm only doing service to the API developer, who feels overwhelmed by the idea of combining subrequests into one cohesive, whole request.\n\nI'd say the developer should catch up.\n\nAlso, as things stand, your idea for a protocol is basically GraphQL but without the nesting.

{"id": "gsvmgmb", "body": "> It doesn't mean you think about all of this when writing a basic query. It's just a set of nested select states with few parameters as a filters, that's **most of it**.\n\nI actually think you are significantly understating the GraphQL protocol here. I agree - that is what people _use_ the protocol for, but GraphQL is _not_ good at just this. I'm arguing, specifically, that splitting the requests is, compared to GraphQL, a better solution. The reasons for this are:\n\n- GraphQL breaks caching: The GraphQL query protocol makes it non-trivial to determine if two query strings will have the same answer, even in what should be trivial cases. For example, the GraphQL format is not whitespace sensitive. This means that two clients can use differing whitespace for an otherwise identical query plan, so caching based on the query even in the most trivial case requires parsing and reformatting the json.\n\n- The GraphQL format is complex. This makes it slow and error-prone to parse, and slow and error-prone to materialize. For example, [field aliases](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Field-Alias) are not helpful for any of the things you discussed (it doesn't reduce data or change data at all in the common case), but it does make caching difficult. Two clients which just disagree on the _name_ of the variable cannot reuse the same cache!\n\nI am _not_ arguing that splitting the requests up is better than a query language that does what you're describing.\n\n> Also, as things stand, your idea for a protocol is basically GraphQL but without the nesting. So it has all drawbacks of GraphQL you listed, regarding caching and what not, and it still doesn't work as a RESTful protocol.\n\nThis is exactly what I'm getting at - and not even the nesting part - selecting the output is exactly what people want when they use GraphQL. Things like [fragments](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Language.Fragments) cause needless complexity and break caching without doing _anything_ to help with reduction of the result. GraphQL _includes_ the query language that does this, but the _extra_ stuff it has hinders the core value add.\n\nWe can let the server decide the general body of what queries are available, while still allowing clients to filter the output.\n\n - Who are my friends, and what are their objects?\n\nLet me rescind my one endpoint per resource idea. Instead, my vision for a protocol that did what you're stating correctly would result in a request like the following, using the same `q` stuffing strategy, structured such that this is the _only_ way to make this request (down to the ordering of arguments, ordering of `q`, and whitespace in q, where invalid orderings result in an error):\n\n    GET https://social.media/api/friends/mine?q=\n\n    \"q\", the query parameter, is the following URL encoded\n \n    id\n    picture [\n      png_highres\n      png_lowres\n    ]\n    username\n\nAnd get a response body like\n\n    [\n      {\n         \"id\": 3,\n         \"picture\": {\n            \"png_highres\": \"https://...\",\n            \"png_lowres\": \"https://...\"\n         }\n         \"username\": \"Tjstretchalot\",\n      },\n      ...\n    ]\n\nObviously this is not a complete specification, and it would need pagination, but you can see that this would be waaay simpler to build a parser for, and would not _sabotage_ caching. It would have the downsides that two clients which request different things get different caches, but two clients who request the _same_ thing would get the _same_ cache.\n\nIt's essentially the subset of GraphQL which adds value. You can select reasonable limits for this type of query, and you can trivially determine that access just requires a logged in user, but after that all the resources are definitely available (or get more complex as is appropriate for this request on your website). \n\nProfiling is easier than GraphQL, caching is easier than GraphQL, you can avoid extra data just like in GraphQL, you have a knowledge about resource relationships just like in GraphQL, you can include business logic when optimizing the query like in REST, it's faster to parse than GraphQL, it's faster to materialize than GraphQL. \n\nIf the GraphQL protocol was like this, I would say it's better than splitting up endpoints.

Consequently, these patterns manifest in\nthe binary and form a coding fingerprint for each author. We\ncan de-anonymize programmers from compiled source code\nwith great accuracy, and furthermore, we can de-anonymize\nprogrammers from source code compiled with optimization\nor after obfuscation. In our experiments, we see that even\nthough basic obfuscation, optimization, or stripping symbols\ntransforms executable binaries more than plain compilation,\nstylistic features are still preserved to a large degree. Such\nmethods are not sufficient on their own to protect programmers\nfrom de-anonymization attacks.\n\nI'm not a machine learning guy, but I think what I get from skimming the paper is that they looked at ~150 different features that distinguish programmers' style *in source code*, then they took source code, compiled it, and decompiled it to see which of those features are preserved. That tells them which types of stylistic information are lost and which aren't. (See section V-J.)\n\nArmed with that information, they can focus on the information that is preserved. At least I think so; that may not be exactly what their technique is, but at any rate, they seem to have shown that some features aren't preserved but some others are.\n\nAnother point from the paper seems to be that although each individual feature doesn't give them that much information about authorship, they have lots of features (53), and combining multiple factors together gives them more certainty.", "author": "adrianmonk", "score": 1}
